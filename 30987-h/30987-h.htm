<p class="head">THE ABORIGINES OF PORTO RICO.</p>


<p>Porto Rico, or Puerto Rico, as it is sometimes called,
has lately become of the first importance in the eyes of
the world. To Americans it has assumed special interest,
as it is now practically in the possession of the
United States, and sooner or later will be represented by
a new star in our beautiful flag, that flag which recently,
by the magnificent exploits of our navy and army, has
assumed a greater importance than ever among the
standards of the universe.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam will certainly find this beautiful and fertile
island a most valuable possession, every foot of
which he could sell at a large substantial price, if he
chose to do so.</p>

<p>Until recently there has been an impression in the
United States that Porto Rico did not amount to much,
that Cuba was the only island in the West Indies which
was of any especial value. But this is the most grievous
error, as we shall endeavor to show in the course of this
little book.</p>

<p>The island, without much exaggeration, can really be
called the garden spot of the world, and there is no
doubt but that when the Stars and Stripes wave <a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>permanently
over it, and there is an influx of American enterprise
and wealth, there will be a marvelous increase
in values of all kinds.</p>

<p>Like all Spanish colonies, Porto Rico has been
wofully mismanaged. The Spaniards have looked upon
it in the light of a more or less valuable cow from which
every drop of milk must be squeezed. But now, under
more fortuitous circumstances, under a more beneficent
rule, the charming little island will undoubtedly
"blossom as a rose"; for those who have looked into
the subject have declared that more can be raised on an
acre of land in Porto Rico than in any other portion of
the globe. Later on we shall examine in detail the truth
or falsehood of this statement.</p>

<p>Porto Rico is older than the United States, for it was
discovered by Columbus on November 16, 1493, during
his second voyage to America. The great discoverer remained
there only two days in the port of Aquadilla,
but he did not come in contact with any of the ingenuous
natives, for they fled in terror when they saw his
ship.</p>

<p>During their subsequent conquests in the West
Indies, the Spaniards paid no attention to Porto Rico
until 1509. At this time Ponce de Leon, then governor
of Hispaniola, afterward known as Hayti, determined
to extend his dominion. With the idea of obtaining
fresh supplies of gold, he went to Porto Rico and made
a long visit to the chief of the natives, by whom he was
received and entertained with the greatest kindness and
hospitality. The chief willingly pointed out to his<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>
Spanish guests all the great resources of the island, and
when, with the greed which has ever distinguished the
men of their country, they asked for gold, he took them
to streams where the sands were loaded with the precious
metal.</p>

<p>Ponce de Leon was so delighted with the beauty and
fertility of the island that he imagined he could find
there the fountain of perpetual youth for which he so
long sought in vain. In this chimerical idea, however,
as in Florida, he was doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>The original name of the island is said to have been
Borinquen, and the population of the natives, who were
of the same race as the inhabitants of the other islands
of the Greater Antilles, has been estimated at six hundred
thousand.</p>

<p>Dr. C. T. Bedwell, recently British consul at Porto
Rico, has published a most interesting report in regard
to the aborigines, and from this report we have obtained
considerable of the information which follows.</p>

<p>Among the Sibaros, or sallow people of to-day, one
rarely sees a physical trace of Indian descent, although
in their mode of living much of Indian character exists.
Fray Inigo Abbad, who wrote a work on Porto Rico,
published in Madrid in 1878, says that when the Spaniards
first came to Porto Rico "it was as thickly populated
as a beehive, and so beautiful that it resembled a
garden." Fray Inigo says that the color of the Indians
of Porto Rico was the copper color known to the aborigines
of America, though they were of a sallow and
somewhat darker complexion. They were shorter in<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>
stature than the Spaniards, stout and well-proportioned.
They had flat noses with wide nostrils, bad teeth and
narrow foreheads. Their heads were flat, both in front
and at the back, "because," says the author, "they
were pressed into this shape at the time of their birth."
They had long, thin, coarse hair, and, according to
Fray Inigo, they were without hair on their face or on
other parts of their body. This, however, is disputed
by some writers.</p>

<p>The small quantity and little substance of the food
they used, the facility with which they supplied material
wants without labor, the excessive heat of the climate,
and the absence of quadrupeds for the exercise of
hunting, caused them, he says, to be weak and indolent,
and averse to labor of all kinds. Anything that was not
necessary to satisfy the pangs of hunger, or that did not
afford amusement, such as hunting or fishing, was regarded
with indifference. Neither the hope of reward
nor the fear of punishment would tempt them to seek
the one or to avoid the other.</p>

<p>Fray Inigo admits, however, that there were some exceptions
among them, and says that some of the Indians
displayed much bravery and strength in the contests
with the Spanish soldiers.</p>

<p>Their forms were light and free, and there were no
cripples among them.</p>

<p>They were governed by Caciques, whose eldest sons
inherited the succession. In the absence of a son the
chief was succeeded by the eldest son of his sister, that
there might be no doubt as to true descent.<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></p>

<p>The tutelary deity was Cerni, who was made to speak
by the Buhitis or medicine men, who were at the same
time the priests. The Buhites hid themselves behind
the statue of Cerni and declared war or peace, arranged
the seasons, granted sunshine or rain, or whatever was
required, according to the will of the Cacique. When
announcements were not fulfilled the Buhites declared
that the Cerni had changed his mind for wise reasons of
his own, "without on this account," says Fray Inigo,
"the power or credit of the pretended deity, or his mendacious
ministers being doubted, such being the simplicity
and ignorance of the Indians."</p>

<p>The chiefdoms were divided into small provinces,
which for the most part only comprised the inhabitants
of a valley; but all were subject to the head Cacique,
who at the time of the conquest was Aqueynoba. He
was actually governor-in-chief, the others being his lieutenants,
who carried out his orders in their respective
districts.</p>

<p>Men and unmarried women wore no clothing, but
painted their bodies abundantly, and with much skill,
drawing upon them many varieties of figures with the
ores, gums and resins which they extracted from trees
and plants. In this uniform they presented themselves
in their military expeditious, public balls, and other
assemblies. To be well painted was to be well dressed,
and they learned from experience besides that the resinous
matter and vegetable oils with which they painted
their bodies served to preserve them from excessive heat
and superabundant perspiration. The paint also served<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
to protect them from the changes of atmosphere, the
dampness of climate, and the plague of the numerous
varieties of mosquitoes and other insects, which, without
this precaution, constantly annoyed them. They
wore headdresses made of feathers with exquisite colors.
They put small plates of gold on their cheeks, and hung
shells, precious stones and relics from their ears and
noses, and the image of their god Cerni was never forgotten.
The chiefs used as a distinctive emblem a large
golden plate worn on their breasts. Married women
wore an apron which descended to about half their leg;
but no clothing was worn on the rest of the body. The
wives of the Caciques wore their aprons to their ankles
except at the national game of ball, when they also wore
short ones.</p>

<p>The men took two, three or more wives, according to
their ability to support them. The chiefs possessed a
larger number of wives than their subjects, but one of
them was generally preferred over all others. The women,
besides their domestic duties, had charge of the
agricultural pursuits and worked in the fields. Those
best loved were buried alive with their husband on his
demise. The men did not intermarry with relatives of
the first degree, from a belief that such marriages resulted
in a bad death.</p>

<p>Their huts were similar in structure and in character
to those of the North American Indians.</p>

<p>The hammock was the chief article of furniture of the
aborigines, and the calabash shell their only cooking
utensil.<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></p>

<p>Their arms were a bow and arrow, in the use of which
they were very skilful. They had canoes both for fishing
and sea voyages. These were hewn out of the timber
of enormous trees, the like of which, owing to fires and
seasons of drouth, no longer exist upon the island.
Some of the canoes were large enough to hold forty or
fifty men.</p>

<p>When the Indians saw that the sick were near to
death they suffocated them. Even the chiefs did not
escape.</p>

<p>After death they opened and dried the body by fire,
and buried it in a large cave, in which were interred
also some live women, the arms of the deceased and
provisions for the journey to the other world. Sticks
and branches of trees were then placed on the top, and
the whole was covered with earth, which was thus kept
from the bodies of those interred.</p>

<p>They were accustomed to perform a national dance
which was called the areito. At the conclusion of this
dance, all became intoxicated with drinks made by the
women of fruit, maize and other ingredients, and with
the smoke of tobacco which they inhaled in their nostrils.</p>

<p>As has been said, at the time of the conquest the
name of the native chief was Aqueynoba. He was
friendly to the Spaniards at first and lived peaceably
with them for some time.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the aborigines were confiding,
generous and peaceful. But, like all savages,
they were very superstitious. They worshipped a vast<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
quantity of idols, but believed in one superior deity.
With the exception of the Caribs, who occupied the
eastern part of the island, they were not cannibals.
They were in the habit of practicing quite a large number
of domestic arts, such as the cultivation of the soil,
the carving in wood and stone, and the manufacture of
pottery and furniture.</p>

<p>The Spaniards have ever been treacherous, selfish and
a nation of money-grubbers.</p>

<p>Now followed an instance which is only one of many
to prove the truth of this statement.</p>

<p>After Ponce de Leon had won the confidence and had
been the recipient of boundless hospitality from the
islanders, he returned to Hayti and at once commenced
to fit out an expedition for the invasion and subjugation
of Porto Rico. From a purely selfish point of view, this
was a most senseless proceeding on his part. He could
have done much better without having any recourse to
force, for at first the natives regarded the Spaniards as
immortal visitors from Heaven, as superior beings
whom they could not kill.</p>

<p>But they speedily recognized their mistake and discovered
the abominable character of the invaders.</p>

<p>De Leon killed off all the natives that he could and
made the rest slaves to work in the gold mines of
Hayti.</p>

<p>When any one resisted he was killed, and if he attempted
to escape he was hunted down by bloodhounds.</p>

<p>It is related that Ponce de Leon had a dog which
became noted as a slave catcher. So valuable was he in<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
this respect that his name was actually carried on the
army payroll for the benefit of his master.</p>

<p>When the natives found that they were being slain or
deprived of their liberty they naturally became exasperated
and turned against their dastardly oppressors.
But from their point of view it was absolutely necessary
to find out if the Spaniards were mortal. If they were
not, it would be an act of impiety to resist them.</p>

<p>This vital question must be settled, and therefore one
of the native chiefs was detailed to try if he could kill a
Spaniard. The trial was eminently successful. A
young man named Salzedo was found alone and was
drowned by the natives.</p>

<p>The action is thus related in the words of a competent
authority:</p>

<p>"The guides conducted Salzedo to the bank of a small
river through which they must pass, and to prevent his
being exposed to the water one of the Indians kindly
offered to take him on his shoulders and carry him over.
Salzedo mounted to his high seat and was borne into
the middle of the stream, when the Indian and his burden
fell into the water. The other Indians immediately
rushed into the river with the apparent purpose of rescuing
their guest, but contrived, while professing to
offer him assistance, to keep his head continually under
water. The result of this practical biological experiment,
so adroitly conducted, brought hope and joy to the despairing
natives. The body was kept immersed until
long after every sign of life had gone, but they
still feared animation might return. Carrying the<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
body to the bank, a new farce was acted; they
lamented over him, they begged his pardon for the
accident, and they protested their innocence of any
design. In every way they provided themselves with a
plausible defense in case he should recover or they
should be suspected. After several days, putrefaction
happily settled all their doubts about the mortality of
their conquerors, and the glad news was communicated
to their people."</p>

<p>The natives then at once commenced to massacre the
Spaniards. But this did not last long. Ponce de Leon
immediately sent for reinforcements, and the Indians
believed that these newcomers were the resurrected
bodies of those they had killed. This idea caused them
to lose all hope and courage, and they fell an easy prey
to their enemies. It was not many years before the
aboriginal population, large as it was originally, was
completely exterminated.</p>

<p>The Spaniards now began to colonize the island and
the town of Capana was the first one settled by them.
Its site was found, however, to be too high and inaccessible.
It was therefore abandoned and in 1511 the present
city of San Juan was founded.</p>

<p>In this city Ponce de Leon built the governor's palace
called Casa Blanca, a structure which is still in use.</p>

<p>After de Leon's unsuccessful expedition to Florida,
where he received a mortal wound at the hands of the
Indians, his remains were brought to Porto Rico and
interred in the Dominican church.</p>

<p>The inscription upon his monument reads as follows:<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></p>

<p><i>Mole sub hac fortis requiescunt ossa Leonis
Qui vicit factis nomina magna suis.</i></p>

<p>These words may be translated into English as follows:</p>

<p>"This narrow grave contains the remains of a man
who was a Lion by name, and much more so by his
deeds."</p>

<p>His cruel treatment of the gentle natives, inspired
though it may have been and probably was by the home
government, by no means causes him to deserve so flattering
an epitaph.<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="head">STRUGGLES OF THE PAST.</p>


<p>Ever since the days of Ponce de Leon, Porto Rico has
been a Spanish possession. It has never been captured,
although many attempts have been made to take it both
by external and internal forces.</p>

<p>None of these attacks seriously affected Spanish
authority on the island.</p>

<p>But although the island has never been taken, it has
been sacked. It may be said that it was pirates who
did this, for while the commanders of several of the expeditions
against the island bore great names, they
were really little more or less than pirates.</p>

<p>The first to attack was no less than the famous English
commander, Sir Francis Drake, who had Elizabeth
behind him. This was in 1595, and Drake then scored
his first failure, in spite of the fact that when he left
his ballast consisted of ducatoons, and the shops of San
Juan were in ruins.</p>

<p>It is rather a strange coincidence that Drake's failure
was due to the fact that the Spaniards had recourse to
the same scheme that was so daringly and successfully
carried out by Lieutenant Hobson in the harbor of Santiago.</p>

<p>They sunk a ship in the neck of San Juan harbor,
thereby preventing Drake's fleet from obtaining an entrance.<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></p>

<p>Dr. Griffin, the accomplished assistant librarian of the
Congressional Library in Washington, has recently been
making a study of Porto Rican literature which has
been pregnant with interesting results.</p>

<p>Dr. Griffin discovered the following in an old English
chronicle:</p>

<p>"Confession of John Austin, mariner of London, of
the late company of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John
Hawkins.</p>

<p>"Directions were given that if any of the fleet lost
company they should make for Guadaloupe in the
Indies; his ship did so, but having lost her rudder
failed, and was taken by five Spanish frigates and the
crew imprisoned in the Isle of St. John de Porto Rico.
Sir Francis, who lost company of Sir John Hawkins,
was told of this by a bark which saw the fight. The
prisoners were examined and threatened with torture
to tell what the English forces were. The Spaniards
sunk ships in the harbor to hinder their entrance. Sir
Francis summoned the town, and on their refusing to
yield sent fifteen vessels to burn the frigates in the harbor.
Two were fired, but the light thus made enabled
the Spaniards to fire on the English ships and drive
them away. The English attacked the fort, but Sir
John Hawkins was killed. Sir Francis sent back to the
governor five prisoners whom he had taken, and begged
that the English might be well treated and sent home,
in which there was an improvement in their diet, etc.
Sir Francis then went to the south of the island, got
provisions and water and went to Carthagena. This was<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>
reported by two frigates that watched him, and then the
treasure ships in Porto Rico with $4,000,000 on board
sailed for Spain, and reached St. Lucas, bringing the
English prisoners, who still remain in prison, but the
examinante escaped. Two fleets, each of twenty-five
ships, and 5,000 men, are said to be sent out to follow
Sir Francis Drake, March 25, 1599."</p>

<p>In Barrow's "Life of Drake," there are further particulars
given of this unsuccessful attack on San Juan,
which was under the command of Sir Francis Drake and
Sir John Hawkins, the two greatest British naval commanders
then living. Barrow says:</p>

<p>"The fitting out and equipment of this grand expedition
were not surpassed by that of 1585 to the West
Indies under Sir Francis Drake, Vice Admiral Forbesher
and Rear Admiral Knolles. Its destination, in the first
place, was intended for Porto Rico, where the queen
had received information that a vast treasure had been
brought, and intended to be sent home from thence for
the use of the King of Spain in completing the third
grand armament (the second having been destroyed by
Drake) which he had in contemplation for the invasion
of England. The object of the present fleet was to intercept
the treasure and thereby cut off the main supply
of his navy and army destined for that purpose.</p>

<p>"Their first intention, however, had been to land at
Nombre de Dios and proceed direct from thence over the
Isthmus of Panama in order to seize the treasure generally
brought thither from the mines of Mexico and
Peru; but in a few days before their departure from<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>
Plymouth they received letters sent by order of the
queen informing them that advices had been received
from Spain announcing the arrival of the West Indian or
Plata fleet, but that one of them, a very valuable ship,
had lost her mast and put into the Island of Puerto
Rico, and it was therefore her majesty's recommendation
that they should proceed direct to that island to
secure the ship and treasure which was on her."</p>

<p>The expedition left Plymouth, August 28, 1595. Before
going to Porto Rico, Drake, against the protest of
Hawkins, tried to take the Canaries and failed. The
voyage was then continued.</p>

<p>"On the 30th of September," the historian continues,
"Captain Wegnot, on the Francis, a bark of thirty-five
tons, being the sternmost of Sir John Hawkins' division,
was chased by five of the king's frigates, or zobras, being
ships of two hundred tons, which came with three
other zobras for the treasure at San Juan de Puerto Rico.
The Francis, mistaking them for companions, was taken
in sight of our caraval. The Spaniards, indifferent to
human suffering, left the Francis driving in the sea
with three or four hurt and sick men, and took the rest
of her people into their ships and returned to Porto
Rico.</p>

<p>"The squadron now intended to pass through the
Virgin Islands, but 'here,' says Hakluyt, 'Sir John
Hawkins was extreme sick, which his sickness began
upon neues of the taking of the Francis.' Remaining
here two days, they tarried two days more in a sound,
which Drake, in his barge had discovered. They then<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>
stood for the eastern end of Porto Rico, where Sir John
Hawkins breathed his last.</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas Baskerville now took possession of the
Garland as second in command. The fleet came to
anchor at a distance of two miles, or less, at the eastern
side of the town of San Juan de Porto Rico, where, says
Hakluyt, 'we received from their forts and places,
where they planted ordnance, some twenty-eight great
shot, the last of which stroke the admiral's ship through
the misen, and the last but one stroke through her quarter
into the steerage, the general being there at supper,
and stroke the stool from under him, but hurt him not,
but hurt at the same table Sir Nicholas Clifford, Mr.
Browne, Captain Stratford, with one or two more. Sir
Nicholas Clifford, and Master Browne died of their
hurts.'</p>

<p>"Drake," continues Barrow, "was certainly imprudent
in suffering the squadron to take up anchorage so
near to the means of annoyance; but his former visit
had no doubt taught the enemy the prudence of being
better prepared for any future occasion, and it is somewhat
remarkable that Drake should not have observed
his usual caution. Browne was an old and particular
favorite of Drake.</p>

<p>"The following morning the whole fleet came to
anchor before the point of the harbor without the town,
a little to the westward, where they remained till nightfall,
and then twenty-five pinnaces, boats and shallops,
well manned, and furnished with fireworks and small
shot, entered the road. The great castle, or galleon<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
the object of the present enterprise, had been completely
repaired, and was on the point of sailing, when certain
intelligence of the intended attack by Drake reached
the island. Every preparation had been made for the
defense of the harbor and the town; the whole of the
treasure had been landed; the galleon was sunk in the
mouth of the harbor; a floating barrier of masts and
spars was laid on each side of her, near to the forts and
castles, so as to render the entrance impassable; within
this breakwater were the five zabras, moored, their
treasure also taken out; all the women and children
and infirm people were moved to the interior, and those
only left in the town who were able to aid in its defense.
A heavy fire was opened on the English ships, but the
adventurers persisted in their desperate attempt, until
they had lost, by their own account, some forty or fifty
men killed, and as many wounded; but there was consolation
in thinking that by burning, drowning and killing,
the loss of the Spaniards could not be less; in fact,
a great deal more; for the five zabras and a large ship
of 400 tons were burned, and their several cargoes of
silk, oil and wine destroyed."</p>

<p>After thus being defeated in his main object, Drake
did not return to San Juan. He contented himself with
laying tribute upon Porto Rico, and burning the towns
on the Caribbean side of the island.</p>

<p>He then sailed for Wombee de Dios, and, when the
fleet was off the South American coast, he died on the
28th of January and was buried at sea. Drake was succeeded
in command by Sir Thomas Baskerville.<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></p>

<p>When the latter was on his way back to England he
encountered a Spanish fleet and engaged in battle off
the Isle of Pines. The victory was decidedly with the
English, but the Spaniards were apparently the same
then as they are to-day. Everybody remembers Blanco's
famous dispatches, famous for their absurd falseness. So
then the Spanish admiral issued a bulletin in which he
claimed a magnificent triumph. Baskerville was so
angry that he publicly declared the admiral to be a liar
and challenged him to a duel. Nothing, however, ever
resulted from this challenge.</p>

<p>Three years later the Duke of Cumberland, who might
also he called a corsair, but a private one, as he acted on
his own hook, attacked San Juan, and after three days'
fighting, laid the city in ruins. He was unable to follow
up his victory, however, as the fever killed his men
by the hundreds.</p>

<p>The English tried to take it in 1615, and again in
1678.</p>

<p>Once more in 1795, seeing the great advantage of
owning the harbor of San Juan, the English attempted
to capture it, but they were repulsed with great
slaughter.</p>

<p>Spain has never given as much attention to Porto
Rico as she has to her other colonies, and therefore the
government, while practically of the same character,
has not been so intolerable as in Cuba and the Philippines.</p>

<p>For nearly three hundred years the island was
neglected. During all that time it was used chiefly as a<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>
watering station for ships and as a penal colony. In
1815 it was thrown open to colonization, and land was
given free to all Spaniards who went there to settle.
As a consequence a host of adventurers hastened to
Porto Rico, as well as a number of Spanish loyalists,
belonging to the better classes, who had been expelled
by the decrees of other and rebellious colonies.</p>

<p>About this time there was a large importation of
negro slaves to work on the sugar plantations. For these
reasons the wealth and population rapidly increased.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there has been a large number of revolutions
against the home government.</p>

<p>As early as 1820, long before Cuba had made any attempt
to throw off the Spanish yoke, the Porto Ricans
made an effort to obtain their independence. After a
short guerilla war, this first rebellion was suppressed,
as were also several other abortive attempts.</p>

<p>In 1868, the year of the great uprising in Cuba, the
most formidable outbreak occurred in Porto Rico.</p>

<p>After two mouths of severe fighting the Spanish regulars
were victorious, and the leader of the rebels, Dr.
Ramon E. Bentances, who has since resided most of the
time in Paris, was captured, as was also J. J. Henna,
afterward a New York physician. All the prisoners were
sentenced to be shot, November 4, 1868.</p>

<p>On the very day preceding that date news came to
the island that Queen Isabella had been deposed,
and in consequence the political prisoners were
released.</p>

<p>But they were afterward banished, and in their exile<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
they have ever since been active in devising measures
for the freedom of the island.</p>

<p>There is no reason whatever to think that there will
be any discontent in the future under the liberal and
beneficent government of the United States.<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="head">TOPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE.</p>


<p>Now that there is no doubt of the acquisition of
Porto Rico by the United States, many of our people
will be going there, and it is therefore of great interest
to note how its general features will please and its climate
be adapted to Americans.</p>

<p>The island is most eastern of the Greater Antilles,
and it is the fourth in size and importance of all the
islands of the West Indies. In fact, in point of density
of population and general prosperity, it takes the first
place. On the east, the Lesser Antilles extend in a
curve toward Trinidad, on the South American coast,
inclosing on the westward the Caribbean sea. A strait
of seventy miles separates Porto Rico from Hayti on the
west, and the distances from San Juan, the capital, to
other points are 2,100 miles to the Cape Verde Islands,
1,050 miles to Key West and 1,420 miles to Hampton
Roads.</p>

<p>Porto Rico lies near enough to the Gulf of Mexico to
receive the benefit of the soft Gulf breezes and the very
best and most desirable of the trade winds.</p>

<p>The island is almost a rectangle in shape. Its length
from east to west is 108 miles and its breadth from north
to south about 37 miles. Its area, including its dependencies,
the isles of Vieques, Culebra and Mona is
3,530 square miles.<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></p>

<p>The coasts are generally regular, but there are a large
number of bays and inlets, and the north coast is full of
navigable lagoons.</p>

<p>The principal capes are San Juan, Mala Pascua, Rojo
and Bruquen.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the conformation of the island is
slightly undulating, with the exception of a mountain
range which traverses it from east to west, running
through nearly its whole length in a zig-zag course, and
on the average about twenty-five miles distant from the
north coast.</p>

<p>This range divides the island into two unequal portions.
The largest is on the north, and the rivers flowing
through that section are much the longer. A part of
the main range is called Sierra Grande or Barros.
The northeast spur is known as the Sierra de Luquillo
and the northwest as the Sierra Larea. The general
height of these mountains is about 1,500 feet above the
sea, but there is one peak, Yunque, which reaches a
height of 3,678 feet. This can be seen seventy miles at
sea, and would be a magnificent place for a shore signal
for the benefit of the ships that sail the South Atlantic
seas.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that there are no extensive lakes in the
highlands of the interior, but there are many interesting
caves in the mountains, the principal ones being
those of Aguas Buenos and Ciales.</p>

<p>The elevated ridge which crosses the island intercepts
the northeast trade winds which blow from the Atlantic
and deprives them of their moisture. The consequence<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>
of this is that the rainfall in the northern portion of the
island is very copious. It also has the effect of reducing
the rain south of the mountains, so that there is a
prevalence of droughts in that section and agriculture
can be advantageously carried on by irrigation. Up to
the present, however, this work of irrigation has been
very imperfect and unsystematic, and the results on the
whole have not been satisfactory.</p>

<p>The Luquillo range ends ten miles from San Juan.
The capital is, therefore, to a certain degree sheltered
by a mountain wall from the rain-bearing winds, which,
in the warmest months blow mainly from easterly points.
Still all the northern adjacent shores and lowlands are
subject to flooding by torrents of rain.</p>

<p>Taking it as a whole, the island is approximately
roof-shaped, so that the rainfall is rapidly drained off.</p>

<p>In the interior are extensive plains and there are level
tracts from five to ten miles wide on the coast.</p>

<p>The soil of Porto Rico is exceedingly fertile. In the
mountains it is a red clay, colored with peroxide of iron,
in the valleys it is black and less compact, and on the
coasts it is sandy, but capable of some culture.</p>

<p>The pasture lands in the northern and eastern parts
of the island are superior to any others in the West
Indies.</p>

<p>Porto Rico is essentially a land of rivers and streams.
Of course none of them are of any great length, but of
the entire number, some thirteen hundred, forty are
navigable for more or less distances for commercial purposes.<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></p>

<p>Mr. John Beggs, a former planter of Porto Rico, says
that the island is perfectly adapted for commerce.
Sugar, coffee, cotton, corn and potatoes are constantly
shipped down the navigable rivers, and were Porto Rico
to be fully cultivated, many more streams could be
opened and communication made between others by
means of canals, so that the entire island would present
a system of water ways which would make it an ideal
place for the shipping of useful articles to the United
States.</p>

<p>The water of the rivers and brooks and lakes is remarkably
pure, and there is quite an industry in its
shipment for sale to other West India islands. It is
stated that more than twenty of these islands send to
Porto Rico for water. Little boats sail up the harbor of
San Juan, fill their tanks with water and sail away
again, Havana's chief scourge is the lack of fresh water,
but Porto Rico has all the water it can use and enough
to supply islands hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>The anchorages can not be said to be the best in the
world, although a few of them are excellent, and most
of them sufficiently deep for ordinary craft.</p>

<p>Mayaguez Bay on the west coast admits vessels of any
size and is the best anchorage on the island. Guanica is
the best on the south coast, of which it is the most
western port. It was here that the American troops first
landed. Still Guanica is not visited by much shipping.
The district immediately surrounding it is low and
swampy, and the roads leading from it are not good.
Guanica has been the outlet for the produce of San German
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>Sabana Grande and, to some extent, of Yanco,
which is on the railroad. The western and southwestern
parts of the island have been particularly over-run by
the Porto Rican rebels, and this has undoubtedly done
much to injure its commerce. But with the advent of the
Americans all this will be changed.</p>

<p>The eastern coast is fairly indented and washed by a
sea which is usually smooth.</p>

<p>On the rugged north side, where the ocean currents set
to southward, there are no good anchorages between
Arecibo and San Juan. The port of San Juan, however,
affords good shelter and will be an important centre for
merchant shipping as well as an attractive rendezvous
for yachts on a pleasure cruise. The harbor is deep
enough to admit large vessels, but its channel communicating
with the sea is winding and difficult, and can be
navigated safely only with the aid of a pilot.</p>

<p>One of the leading seaports of the island is Aquadilla
on the west coast. This has the advantage of a spacious
bay, which is sheltered from the trade winds. From this
place are shipped the sugar and coffee produced in the
northwest part of the island.</p>

<p>There are seven or eight other ports of minor importance.</p>

<p>The main highway of central Porto Rico runs from
Ponce to San Juan, in a northeasterly direction, through
Juana Diaz, Coamo and Abonito. From the latter place
it proceeds almost eastward to Cayey, and there it takes
a winding course to the north as far as Caquas. Thence
it turns west to Aquas Buenos, and then goes straight<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>
north through Guaynola and Rio Piedras to San Juan.
The entire length of this highway is about eighty-five
miles.</p>

<p>The distance from Ponce to San Juan, as the bird flies,
is only forty-five miles.</p>

<p>And now to take up a most important point&mdash;the climate.
Of this much can be said in favor.</p>

<p>On the whole, it may be stated that Porto Rico, for
a tropical region, is very healthful; in fact, by far the
most so of any of the West India islands.</p>

<p>There have been no climatic observations which cover
the whole of the Porto Rican territory, but the Spanish
Weather Bureau has published certain observations
which show the general conditions prevailing in San
Juan and the vicinity.</p>

<p>The climate, though hot, is agreeably tempered by
the prevailing northeast winds. At night there is always
a pleasant breeze which carries sweet fragrance along
the northern coast. A temperature as high as 117 degrees
has been recorded, but this is most unusual. At
San Juan, the average temperature in August is about
81 degrees Fahrenheit; in September, 80.5 degrees, and
in October, 79.3 degrees. At night it sinks to 68 or 69
degrees, which is more than it frequently does in New
York or Chicago during heated spells. The most marked
feature of the climate is that the summer's heat and
rainfall keep up until late autumn. In the hottest
months the calm days average not far from ten a
month, and these have a very relaxing effect. For this
reason it is advisable for residents of temperate climes<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>
not to visit Porto Rico until November, when the
weather becomes beautifully fine and settled, and almost
always continues good during the winter and early
spring.</p>

<p>The rainfall in San Juan, which can be taken as a fair
index of that along the northeastern coast, averages
about 6.65 inches during August, 5.30 during September
and 7.10 during October. But in some years the
heaviest fall was in September. Not infrequently the
cultivated fields and plantations are inundated, and
swamps are formed. As has been intimated, the southern
part of the island is relatively much drier than the
northern, though the former is apt to experience excessive
rains during the passage of a hurricane.</p>

<p>It is fortunate for Porto Rico that it does not lie
directly in the track of West Indian cyclones. It has
been visited, however, at long intervals by devastating
hurricanes, notably those of 1742 and 1825, which destroyed
a vast deal of property, and during the passage
of which many lives were lost. The terrible tornadoes
of the tropics are very erratic in their course, and are so
apt to be deviated from their accustomed paths that it
is unsafe to assume that danger has passed for Porto
Rico until late in the autumn. Captains of all vessels
during the summer mouths should therefore exercise extraordinary
vigilance to avoid being caught in a hurricane.</p>

<p>The prevailing diseases of the island are yellow fever,
elephantiasis, tetanus, March fever and dysentery.
There is no question but that a lack of proper sanitary<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>
measures is responsible for much of the illness. Even
the most to be dreaded of these diseases, yellow fever,
could in all probability be rooted out if proper precautions
were taken and every available means employed to
prevent its recurrence. As it is, yellow fever never
scourges Porto Rico as it does parts of Cuba.</p>

<p>In the winter and early spring Porto Rico is less subject
than Cuba to those chilling winds that blow from
the freezing anticyclones moving east from the American
coast toward Bermuda. Under American auspices
and enlightened systems of sanitation, there will doubtless
spring up a number of attractive winter resorts,
which will prove formidable rivals to those of Florida,
especially if, as is not unlikely, San Juan Bay becomes
the headquarters of the North Atlantic naval station
from November until April.</p>

<p>In this regard, the manager of a prominent life insurance
company has spoken as follows:</p>

<p>"Let me raise my voice in prophecy and then wait
and see if events do not bear me out. I want to prophesy
right now that five years from date that island will be
a great popular winter resort. No one can appreciate its
natural attractions unless he has been there, and when
to them have been added a few good American hotels it
is bound to become a popular resort.</p>

<p>"I was in Porto Rico several years ago, and I
then expressed surprise that it was not boomed as a
winter resort. The Porto Ricans to whom I spoke
shrugged their shoulders and smiled. The ground is
high, the climate is fine, and the place is healthful.<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></p>

<p>"It has many attractions of its own that are lacking
in the other West Indies.</p>

<p>"Close on the heels of the army will march some enterprising
American hotel man, and then look out for
results."<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="head">POPULATION AND TOWNS.</p>


<p>According to the latest statistics, the entire population
of the island of Porto Rico is estimated at 900,000.
Of these about 140,000 are <i>peninsulares</i>, as the natives
of Spain have been termed throughout her former colonies.
From 12,000 to 14,000 are foreigners, mostly
Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, Englishmen and Americans.
Other nationalities have little or no representation.
The so-called native population is composed of two-thirds
whites who are descendants of Spaniards and
people of other European countries, and one-third
negroes and mulattoes or those of mixed blood, half
castes, as they are denominated.</p>

<p>It is valuable to note the large proportion of whites,
which is very unusual for a tropical country.</p>

<p>The census, which was taken December 31, 1887,
states that the women outnumbered the men by about
one thousand. As the immigrants from Spain are mostly
men, however, the actual ratio between the two sexes,
as far as the native population is concerned, would be
greatly in favor of the feminine.</p>

<p>The area of Cuba is thirteen times larger than that of
Porto Rico, and yet even before the butcher Weyler exterminated
a third of the native Cubans, it contained
not quite double as many people as the smaller island.<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></p>

<p>This will give some idea of the density of the population
of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>Thirty per cent. of the whites and seventy-five per
cent. of the negroes were classed in the census of 1887
as laborers.</p>

<p>The western part of the island is far more densely
populated than the eastern. The reason for this probably
lies in the fact that the east coast is on the windward
side, and offers less protection for shipping. Consequently
it is not so conveniently situated for trade.
All the larger towns of the east are situated inland, or,
at least, some distance from the coast. They are in the
hilly portion of the island and surrounded by rich coffee
plantations and grazing lands of large extent.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Porto Rico are scattered all over the
country, and the land is greatly subdivided. The Spanish
authorities have made many efforts to collect the
people into villages, but the people themselves have
frequently resisted a change which they considered
would not suit the conditions of their lives or tend to
improve their finances.</p>

<p>Still, in the last fifty years more than half of the
population has gravitated to and around the towns,
especially those which are situated on the seashore.
Most of these people live in comfortable houses, and
have the means to provide themselves with all the
necessities and many of the luxuries of life.</p>

<p>The population, by the way, has been steadily increasing
since the beginning of the present century.</p>

<p>Ponce, named after Ponce de Leon, is the largest city<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>
and the one of the most commercial importance upon the
island. It is beautifully situated about three miles north
of the port of Ponce, in a fertile plain, and is surrounded
by plantations and gardens. It is the terminus
of one of the three short railroads which have
been constructed, and along the beach in front of the
port are large warehouses, where the produce, forwarded
through Ponce, which is the trading centre, is stored
for shipment. The population of Ponce has been estimated
at 44,500 inhabitants, and this is probably not
far from the actual truth.</p>

<p>Ponce has quite a number of fine buildings, including
the town hall, the theatre, two churches, the charity and
the woman's asylums, the barracks, the Cuban House
and the market. Between the city and the seashore is an
excellent road which forms a beautiful promenade.</p>

<p>Near Ponce are hot springs which are quite famous
and held in high estimation by invalids.</p>

<p>The capital of Porto Rico is San Juan, which in many
respects has always been the most important city. It is
on the north coast, and as has already been stated, was
founded by Ponce de Leon in 1510. It now has a population
of 31,250 inhabitants, which includes the town
and its suburbs.</p>

<p>The situation of San Juan is somewhat peculiar, as it
is built on a high and narrow peninsula, which is separated
from the mainland by shallow water spanned by
a bridge known as the San Antonio.</p>

<p>The town is about half a mile wide, inclosed by high
walls of masonry, which are very picturesque, and with<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>
their portcullis gates and battlements recall vividly to
one's mind the description of mediæval times.</p>

<p>The bluff is crowned by Morro Castle, rendered
familiar to Americans in the recent war.</p>

<p>San Juan is really quite a beautiful place with straight
and narrow streets and many imposing buildings. It has
a number of public institutions and colleges, several
churches, and seven small parks. Among the latter may
be mentioned the Plazuela de Santiago, in which is an
excellent statue of Columbus.</p>

<p>It was on the western end of the island that Ponce de
Leon built the governor's palace, which is enclosed
within the Santa Catalina fortifications, where are also
the cathedral, town house and theatre. This portion of
the city is now known as Pueblo Viego, and is the seat
of an Episcopal see, which is subordinate to the bishop
of Santiago de Cuba.</p>

<p>The city is lighted by gas, which is controlled by an
English company, and it also has an electric plant
under local management.</p>

<p>There is a local telephone company.</p>

<p>There are eleven newspapers of various descriptions,
the chief one being La Correspondencia, a local political
paper, which has a circulation of seven thousand copies,
more than that of all the other papers put together.</p>

<p>The water is obtained entirely from cisterns. About
fifty years ago a project was formed to build a reservoir,
and the plans were approved by the government. But,
with that spirit of procrastination so characteristic of
the Spanish, in all public and private walks of life, and<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>
which is known as manana, the reservoir has never been
completed.</p>

<p>The harbor of San Juan is in almost all respects a
very fine one. On the east and south it is surrounded
by swamps, and on the west it is protected by the
islands of Cabra and Cabrita, which are practically connected
to the mainland by sandbars. There are strong
fortifications which guard the entrance to the outer
harbor.</p>

<p>The inner harbor is spacious and landlocked. It has
been dredged to a uniform depth of twenty-nine feet
from the docks to the anchorage.</p>

<p>The old city is divided into four wards, three of which
are outside of the fortifications. The houses are of stone,
or brick, and from the roofs beautiful sea views may be
obtained. In the patio or court of almost every house
there is a garden.</p>

<p>Besides Ponce and San Juan, the largest towns on the
island are Arecibo (30,000 inhabitants), Utuado
(31,000), Mauaguez (28,000), San German (20,000)
Yanco (25,000), and Juana Diaz (21,000). There are
also about a dozen other towns with a population of 15,000
or over.</p>

<p>These figures are only approximate, as no regular census
has been taken in ten years, and even then the Spanish
officials were none too correct.</p>

<p>Railways on the island can as yet be said to be only
in their infancy. There is only about 150 miles of railroad,
with about as much more in construction. It is
intended to have stretches of railroad parallel with the<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>
coast, which shall make the entire circuit of the island.
From these there will be short branches to all the seaports
and inland markets.</p>

<p>The cart roads are very primitive, some of them being
little better than cattle tracks. There is, however, be
it remembered, one fine road, which extends across the
island from San Juan to Ponce.</p>

<p>The telegraph system is also in a very incomplete
state and is poorly managed.</p>

<p>There is one line of cable which runs to Cuba,
Mexico, Panama and the coasts of the South American
continent, and another which connects the island with
St. Thomas, Jamaica, and thus the rest of the world.<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="head">RESOURCES.</p>


<p>It is somewhat difficult to tell exactly what is the
commercial value of the new colonial possessions which
the Spanish-American war has placed at the disposal of
the United States. The figures are naturally based upon
the conditions which prevailed under Spanish rule.</p>

<p>But, all for all, it may be said that Porto Rico, taking
into consideration its area, has been the most valuable
of all Spain's colonial possessions.</p>

<p>For some reason, which seems to be inscrutable,
Spain has given the inhabitants of Porto Rico far better
treatment than she accorded to the natives of Cuba. She
dealt with the island more as if it were a Spanish
province than a colony to be bled to the fullest extent
possible for the financial benefit of Spanish officials and
the mother country. Quite the contrary has been the
case in Cuba and the Philippines.</p>

<p>It may be stated that, as a matter of fact, Porto Rico
has been, in a political sense, a province of Spain for
the past twenty years.</p>

<p>Spain has paid but little attention to internal improvements,
but this has been an advantage. For with
her heavy hand relaxed, the people have had a certain
opportunity to develop such spirit of enterprise as they
possessed.</p>

<p>Porto Rico, in proportion to its size, is immensely<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>
wealthy. It is very doubtful if the Philippines can
equal it in richness, square foot for square foot.</p>

<p>With the island in the possession of the United States
and with the abolishment of the differential duties in favor
of the Spanish government, its geographical position will
undoubtedly cause most of its commerce to flow to and
from the ports of the United States.</p>

<p>There will be a market furnished for great quantities
of food products, textile fabrics, iron, steel and coal.
From the island the United States will chiefly receive
coffee, tobacco and sugar. Indeed it may be said that in
the line of coffee cultivation, the greatest development
of Porto Rico may be expected in the near future.</p>

<p>Mr. John Beggs, whom we have quoted before, says
that Porto Rico is one of the finest pieces of property
on the earth's surface. May it prove so in the hands
of the United States!</p>

<p>The soil of Porto Rico is of remarkable fertility. Its
dominant industries may be said to be agriculture and
lumbering.</p>

<p>In the elevated regions, most of the vegetable productions
of the temperate zone can be grown.</p>

<p>More than five hundred varieties of trees can be found
in the forests of the island, many of which are very
valuable, and the plains are full of palms, oranges and
other fruit-bearing trees. There are several very interesting
trees, especially a beautiful <i>Talauma</i>, with immense
white odorous flowers and silvery leaves. This
tree is exceedingly ornamental. It is used for lumber
and called Sabiuo. A <i>Kirtella</i> with crimson flowers is<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>
also rather common. A tree which is called Ortegon by
the natives is found at high altitudes, but chiefly near
the coast. It has immense purple spikes, more than a
yard long, and is very striking. It seems to be confined
to Porto Rico and Hayti. There are many varieties of
cabinet and dye woods, including mahogany, ebony,
lignum vitæ, cedar and logwood. Plants valuable in
the arts and pharmacy abound. Tropical fruits grow
everywhere to perfection.</p>

<p>The chief products of Porto Rico, outside of lumber,
may be said to be sugar, coffee, tobacco, rice, honey
and wax, and these have greatly enriched the island,
making many of the people well-to-do.</p>

<p>Sugarcane is cultivated on the fertile plains, yielding
three hogsheads on an average per acre without any
manure.</p>

<p>An excellent grade of coffee is produced, and it does
not appear that as yet any blight has perceptibly affected
the shrubs.</p>

<p>Rice is very commonly cultivated on the hills in the
Sierra. It must be a kind of mountain variety, as no
inundation or other kind of watering is used.</p>

<p>Rice and plaintain are in fact the staple food of the
natives.</p>

<p>Cotton and maize are also raised to a certain extent.</p>

<p>There should in the future be an industry from the
manufacture of tannin extracts from the bark of Coccolala,
Rhizophora and the pods of various acacias, the
latter of which are a great nuisance on account of their
rapid growth.<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></p>

<p>There are a long number of fruits on the island, such
as cherries, guava plums, juicy mangoes and bell apples.</p>

<p>Edwin Emerson, Jr., a war correspondent, speaks of
some of the fruits as follows:</p>

<p>"The most astonishing and the best of all was a fruit
called pulmo&mdash;in our language, sour-sap. It is about as
large as a quart bowl, and so nourishing and full that a
single fruit was enough for a good meal, although that
did not deter my horse from eating four. Later I found
that they are also relished by dogs. Of springs and
streams there were so many that I had no fear of dying
of thirst. If water was not handy, I could always climb
a cocoanut tree and throw down the green nuts, which
were filled with an abundance of watery milk, more
than I could drink at one time. Other nuts there were
in plenty; but many were more curious than edible,
even to my willing appetite. One had a delicious odor.
I tasted a little, and thought it ideal for flavoring candy.
But it soon dissolved in my mouth in a fine dust, absorbing
all the moisture, so that I had to blow it out
like flour. Nothing ever made me so thirsty in my life,
and even after rinsing out my mouth I felt for a long
time as if I were chewing punk or cotton. The fruit of
the tamarind only added to my torments by setting all
my teeth on edge. When we reached the next spring I
fell off my horse for fear he would get all the water.
Only after I had satisfied my thirst would I let him
drink."</p>

<p>The poverty of the fauna and flora is remarkable,
there being scarcely any wild animals, birds or flowers.<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></p>

<p>There is a great deficiency of what may be called
<i>native</i> animals of any sort.</p>

<p>The most troublesome quadruped is the wild dog,
which chiefly attack pigs and other small domestic animals.
Mice are probably the greatest pest of the island,
but they are considerably kept down by their natural
enemies, the snakes. The latter not infrequently reach
a length of from six to nine feet. There are a good
many mosquitoes, but they are no worse than they are
in New Jersey. Numerous species of ants and bees exist
as well as fireflies. The latter occasionally fly in great
masses, producing beautiful effects in the tropical nights.</p>

<p>It may be stated that, on the whole, Porto Rico is
singularly free from those noxious reptiles and insects
which seem to inherit the rest of the West Indies as
their peculiar possession.</p>

<p>Immense pastures occupy a part of the lowland, and
feed large herds of cattle of an excellent quality. St.
Thomas and the French islands all obtain their butcher's
meat from Porto Rico. Even Barbadoes comes there for
cattle. Sheep always thrive in a hot country, and they
grow big and fat in Porto Rico. Fresh lamb and mutton
are constantly shipped from there. A very numerous
class of the people are shepherds, and these live upon
mutton and the kind of highland rice, already alluded
to, which is very easily prepared for food.</p>

<p>Poultry is most abundant, and the seas and rivers are
full of the finest fish.</p>

<p>Agriculture has hitherto been almost exclusively in
the hands of the natives, but most of the business and<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>
commerce have been controlled by foreigners and Spaniards
from the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Although the island is certainly well developed agriculturally,
it certainly admits of considerable expansion
in this direction. Under a different political system, and
when it is freed from the oppressive and vexatious taxation,
Porto Rico will certainly become far more productive
and prosperous even than it is now.</p>

<p>There is no question but that the island, richly endowed
as it is by Nature, has been miserably governed.</p>

<p>But agriculture in the near future will certainly not
be the main industry of the island. For there are known
to be gold, copper, iron, zinc and coal mines, which
have never been developed. In fact, strange as it may
appear, none of these valuable mines is worked at all.
The vegetable productions have been considered so
valuable that in order to cultivate them the minerals
have been neglected. There are also extensive sponge
fields, which are very valuable, but which have not been
touched, owing to several causes, chiefly the lack of
capital. The same can also be said of the quarries of
white stone, granite and marble.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of salt, which is sure to be
of importance. There are large quantities of salt obtained
from the lakes. Salt works have been established
at Guanica and Salinas, on the south coast, and at Cape
Rojo, on the west. This constitutes the principal mineral
industry of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>Hot springs and mineral waters are found at Juan
Diaz, San Sebastian, San Lorenzo and Ponce, but the<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>
most famous are at Coamo, near the town of Santa Isabella.</p>

<p>It is now interesting to see what the trade of Porto
Rico has been with other countries, and especially the
United States during recent years.</p>

<p>A very large part of the island's trade has been carried
on with the United States, where corn, flour, salt-meat,
fish and lumber have been imported in return for
sugar, molasses and coffee.</p>

<p>The natives are not a sea faring people, and care little
or nothing for ships of their own. Therefore, by far the
larger part of their trade with other countries has been
carried on by the means of foreign ships.</p>

<p>Porto Rico has paid into the Spanish treasury about
4,000,000 pesos annually, which is equivalent to about
$800,000.</p>

<p>In normal years, that is, when no war was going on,
the total value of imports into the island amounted to
about $8,000,000, and the exports to about $16,000,000.</p>

<p>The latest Spanish statistics, that is, during 1896,
give the importations into Porto Rico as amounting to
$18,945,793, and the exports to $17,295,535.</p>

<p>The average entrances of ships into the ports have
been 1919 vessels of an aggregate of 327,941 tons, of
which 544 of 81,966 tons were British. Articles of import
have been distributed by countries as follows:</p>

<p>From Spain come wines, rice, oils, flour and textiles;
from England, machinery, textiles, salted provisions,
rice and coal; from France, a small amount of textiles,
some jewelry and perfumery, and some fine wines and<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
liquors; from Italy, wines, vermicelli and rice; from
Germany, glass and porcelain wares, textiles, paper,
cheese, candied fruits, beer and liquors; from Holland,
cheese; from Cuba, rum, sugar and tobacco; from the
United States, petroleum, ironware, glassware, chemicals,
textiles, paper, lumber, barrels, machinery, carriages,
dried and salted meats, butter, grease, codfish,
flour, coal, fruits, vermicelli and cheese.</p>

<p>A commercial arrangement was entered into between
the United States and Spain in 1895, in consequence of
which the following proclamation was issued by the
Spanish Government:</p>


<p class="head">PROCLAMATION:</p>

<p>The executive is authorized to apply to the products
and manufactures of the United States which coming
from the ports of the United States be admitted into
the ports of Cuba and Porto Rico, the benefits of the
second column of the tariffs in said islands; provided
that the United States, in their turn apply their lowest
rates of duty to the products of the soil and of the industry
of Cuba and Porto Rico.</p>

<p>This modus vivendi shall be in force until a permanent
commercial treaty between the two parties concerned
is concluded, or until one of them gives notice
to the other, three months in advance of the day on
which it wishes to put an end of it.</p>

<p>Therefore, I command all the courts, justices, chiefs,
governors and other authorities, civil, military and
ecclesiastical, of all classes and dignities, to observe<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
and cause to be observed, obeyed and executed this present
law in all its parts. Given in the palace, February 4,
1895.
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">I, the Queen Regent.</span></p>

<p>Alejandro Groizard, Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The above is translated from the Gaceta de Madrid of
February 6, 1895.</p>

<p>This agreement, if so it can be called, is of course
now at an end. Hereafter Porto Rico will enjoy all the
privileges of a colony of the United States.</p>

<p>But still it is interesting to note the duty on the leading
articles of export from the United States to Porto
Rico, as expressed in the second column of the Spanish
tariff.</p>

<p>This was as follows:</p>

<table summary="tarrif"

cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="bottom"><td>Wheat flour, rice flour, buckwheat flour, cornmeal,
oatmeal, barleymeal, ryemeal, per 100

</table>

<p>One hundred kilograms amounts to something over
two hundred pounds.<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></p>

<p>The people on the island are rather luxurious, so
much so that in one year five million dollars worth of
goods were carried there. These goods consisted principally
of manufactured products, such as clothing and
household wares.</p>

<p>The principal exports from the United States have
been flour, pork, lard, lumber and shooks.</p>

<p>But, of course, all this will be largely increased now
that Porto Rico is practically a portion of the United
States, and the increased commerce will be to the advantage
of both.</p>

<p>During the five years from 1893 to 1897, the trade of
Porto Rico with the United States has been as follows:</p>

<table summary="trade"

<p>Whatever disadvantages Porto Rico may possess, and
when all is said and done, they are beyond question few,
it is certainly lovely enough and prolific enough to
make one forget them all.</p>

<p>A writer in Ainslee's Magazine concludes his very
clever article as follows, and undoubtedly every word he
says is true:</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for the development of Spanish countries
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>the mental activity of the people is principally
manifested in an exuberant imagination which finds expression
in superlative and poetical language. If there
were any corresponding creative genius and executive
ability in material affairs such a fertile and well-watered
land as Puerto Rico would be the home of one of the
richest communities on the globe. By her situation she
is adapted to become the centre of a flourishing commerce
whose goods might be carried down dozens of
navigable rivers from the interior of the island. Under
a good government, with enterprising colonists, the
natural resources of the island, some of which have been
scarcely touched, would bring comfort and wealth to a
large population."<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="head">MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.</p>


<p>Let us examine briefly in the first place what has
been the management of Porto Rico under Spanish rule,
or, rather, perhaps we should call it mismanagement,
for no one of Spain's colonies has ever been properly
directed.</p>

<p>Porto Rico has been governed under a constitution
voted by the Spanish Cortes in 1869. The government
has been administered by a captain-general, assisted by
an administrative council appointed at Madrid.</p>

<p>The revenue has been about four millions of dollars a
year, considerably more than half of which has been derived
from customs, and the rest from taxation, direct
and indirect.</p>

<p>The captain-general was president of the superior tribunals
of justice and of the superior juntas of the capital;
but the fiscal administration had a special chief
called intendant. The supreme judicial power lay in a
royal <i>audience</i>. Justice was administered in the cities
and in the country by judges of the first instance and by
alcaldes. There were nine special tribunals: civil,
ecclesiastical, war, marine, artillery, engineers, administration,
probate and commerce.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical affairs were presided over by a bishop
chosen by the crown and approved by the pope.</p>

<p>For administrative purposes the island and its dependencies
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>were divided into nine districts: Porto Rico,
Bayamon, Arecibo, Aquadilla, Mayaguez, Ponce,
Humacoa, Guayama and Vieques.</p>

<p>The Spanish administration in Porto Rico, although
not so bad as in other colonies, has, nevertheless, been
one of cruelty and oppression. The Spaniards, as will
be remembered, began by exterminating the native Indian
population in less than a century.</p>

<p>There was not a branch of the administration which
was not conducted under a system of corruption. The
law was constantly violated by the Spaniards, and the
natives deprived of their rights.</p>

<p>When elections took place the Spanish or Conservative
party always won, and this in spite of the fact that this
party was in a large minority. No more corrupt and
farcical elections have even been known to take
place.</p>

<p>Such a thing as liberty of the press was utterly unknown.
Articles that had been printed in the Madrid
or other Spanish papers attacking the government could
not be reproduced in any Porto Rican papers, without
the editors being arrested and punished. And this
occurred even if the article in question had not been
considered as offering ground for the prosecution by the
authorities in Spain.</p>

<p>The papers, by the way, were ridiculously inadequate
in every sense of the word. Only one attempt was ever
made to establish a magazine. This was about eleven
years ago. It was called the <i>Revista Puertorriquena</i>
and was intended "to carry the highest expression of<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>
our intellectual culture to all the people of Europe and
America where the magnificent Castilian language is
spoken."</p>

<p>The magazine was conducted by a committee composed
of a director, two editors, "and other illustrious
persons" elected by the subscribers. The founder of the
magazine lamented that the "race of artists" who first
settled in Puerto Rico "were so overwhelmed by the
exuberant and pompous beauty of the tropics that the
natural means of artistic expression were exaggerated
to the detriment of ideas," and that the crying evil of
the periodical press of the island was "the abundance of
sonorous and high-sounding articles having nothing to
say to the understanding."</p>

<p>The founder of the magazine was Don Manuel Juncos,
who is the author of several books of travel. He speaks
of the Brooklyn bridge as "a magic vision of the Thousand
and One Nights," while the smoke that rose from
myriads of New York chimneys "formed the holy and
blessed incense of a mighty and busy population, rising
directly up to God from the fecund altar of labor." In
the streets he was amazed at the "incessant avalanche
of men, all having the purpose of certain or probable
utility."</p>

<p>No more than nineteen persons, under the old regime,
were allowed to meet in any place of the island, without
special permission from the government, and the mayor
of the town was obliged to attend the meetings to see
that nothing was said or done against "the integrity of
the nation."<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></p>

<p>Licenses were required for everything, even for an
ordinary dancing party.</p>

<p>The manner of life in the large towns of Porto Rico
is not dissimilar from that of European countries, with
the exception of some slight differences due to the heat
of the climate. The fashions for men and women alike
are imported, especially from Paris and London. Those
who are in comfortable circumstances dress just like
people in European countries. The men wear woolen
clothes all the year round. The young women dress
very elaborately and all wear hats, the Spanish mantilla
being adopted by elderly women only.</p>

<p>In the small towns, men dress after the fashion of the
cities, except that their clothes are made of linen.
Woolen fabrics are uncomfortable, and they are considered
a luxury to be donned only on Sundays and holidays.</p>

<p>Laborers and farm hands wear neither coats nor shoes.
They do not care to do so, in the first place, and, in the
second, they could not afford to, as their earnings are
very small.</p>

<p>In San Juan the streets are rectangular and are closely
built with brick houses usually two or three stories,
stuccoed on the outside, and painted in different colors.
In one house live several families, and the degree of
rent, as well as of social position, rises with the height
of the floor above the ground.</p>

<p>The lower floors, as a rule, are very dirty, and are
crowded in a most unhealthful way by negroes and the
servants of those who live above.<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></p>

<p>Sanitary conditions, by the way, as in all Spanish
possessions, are the very worst possible, and much will
have to be done in this respect when the United States
takes permanent possession.</p>

<p>There is one feature which strikes every foreigner,
and that is the roof gardens. In many parts of the
island, especially in the smaller towns, the whole population
enjoys itself at night on the housetops. The
houses are built a little off the ground, and they look
not unlike castles in the air which have been built for
pleasure rather than for living purposes.</p>

<p>In all tropical countries people have the habit of
sleeping in the daytime, and do their shopping and
attend to their social duties in the evening. In Porto
Rico this custom is almost universal.</p>

<p>Every man of any means is the possessor of two
houses, a town house and a country house. At carnival
times, or when any special celebration is going on, he
takes his family to town and brings them back again
when the sport is over.</p>

<p>Poverty is almost unknown in Porto Rico, for almost
every man owns his horse and every woman is the possessor
of chickens. Horseback riding is an almost universal
pastime. There are many fine horses on the
island, and they are used daily by men and women.</p>

<p>The inhabitants have but few wants which are not
satisfied by Nature without any effort on their part. They
lead a <i>dolce far niente</i> existence, swinging to and fro in
their hammocks all day long, smoking cigarettes and
strumming guitars.<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></p>

<p>Life at San Juan and the other principal towns is
more or less monotonous, amusements being few. There
is a <i>retreta</i> or concert by the military bands twice a
week and theatrical performances three or four evenings
a week. Matinees are very seldom given. The theatres
are owned by the cities and rented to European and
American companies traveling through the island at so
much an evening.</p>

<p>Unlike Cuba, there are no bull fights, but cock fighting
may be called the national sport, and is universally
indulged in. Game cocks are the greatest attraction of
the markets. Every Sunday there are public fights in
the cockpit, and these are invariably accompanied by
betting, often very large amounts being involved.</p>

<p>Gambling, by the way, may be said to be universal.
Every one, from the rich planter down to the lowest
laborer and beggar, is given up to this vice, and will
squander away every dollar if the mood takes him.</p>

<p>There is nothing but hospitality on the island. The
people are exceedingly polite to strangers, and the traveler
who offers money deeply offends his host.</p>

<p>A curious feature of the streets is the milk delivery,
which is not unlike that prevailing in Cuba.</p>

<p>This takes place before and during the noon, or breakfast,
hour, breakfast being taken here between 12 and 2
o'clock. Sometimes the milk is still being sold at 4 or 5
o'clock. The milkman drives from door to door from
one to four or five cows, each branded with a number
and usually one or more of them accompanied by a calf.
The driver cries his approach, and the customer fetches<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>
sends out a pan, pail, bottle, or cup, which he hands
to the milkman. The milkman puts into the receptacle
the quantity of milk paid for, which he induces the cow
to yield after the usual manner.</p>

<p>Mr. W. G. Morrisey gives an interesting description
of how funerals are conducted in Porto Rico. He says
that when a native dies preparations are immediately
made for the burial.</p>

<p>No women are allowed to attend the funeral and the
casket is carried on the shoulders of four natives. The
cemetery being reached, the remains are deposited in
one of the many vaults in the place, provided the sum
of four pesos per year is paid to the authorities. If this
sum is not forthcoming the corpse is placed in a corner
of the graveyard and left there to decay. Mr. Morrisey
said it was a common occurrence to see seven or eight
funerals pass by every day.</p>

<p>Another thing that struck Mr. Morrisey was the railroad
that runs from Ponce to Playo. The train is made
up of an old-fashioned engine and three cars. There are
first, second and third class coaches, the only difference
between the first and second class being the seats in the
first class coach, which are cushioned. It is first class in
name only, and very few of the visitors and the better
class of natives use it, because of the fact that the
cushions are full of vermin. Everything seems to be
filthy, from the Hotel Ingleterra, which is considered
the best house in Ponce, to the most miserable of huts
on the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>Mr. Morrisey said that it is not a question of one place<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>
being cleaner than the other, but one place not being as
filthy as another.</p>

<p>The facilities for lighting the city at night were investigated,
and it was found that very little light is
used. The stores are lighted with one or two incandescent
lights, which are put in by the managers of a
small electric light plant that has been in operation for
some time. Kerosene oil cannot be bought for less than
forty cents a pint, and consequently is not used to any
great extent. An ice plant has also been established in
Ponce, where they manufacture ice in small cakes about
the size of a brick. This sells at $1.50 per hundred-weight.</p>

<p>There is no public school system, and a large number
of even the white population can neither read nor write.
The daughters of the well-to-do are sent to convents on
the island, while the sons go abroad to be educated.
Among this latter class there is considerable culture and
refinement, and most of them speak English.</p>

<p>The women are of medium size, but exquisitely
formed. They have all the coquetry which is typical of
the women of the tropics, and no one who visits Porto
Rico can fail to be impressed with their beauty, delicacy
and grace.</p>

<p>It has been affirmed that Porto Rico has been in the
past a perfect Mecca for fugitives from justice. At one
time no less than one hundred of this description were
traced there.</p>

<p>It is really possible to live on very little money there,
and lives are prolonged to an incredible period. Fugitives
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>therefore find it a haven in which to turn over a
new leaf and begin a better life.</p>

<p>The Porto Ricans are naturally Roman Catholics and
are very devout.</p>

<p>The manner of keeping Sunday would be apt to shock
our New Englanders of Puritan descent.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the New York Sun, who was with
the army in Porto Rico speaks of this as follows:</p>

<p>"Sunday at Ponce, if it continues as at present, will
add still further variety to the somewhat different observances
of the day which now characterize the territory
of the United States.</p>

<p>"'To-morrow,' said a native last Saturday, 'to-morrow
I shall go to the theatre.'</p>

<p>"'It's Sunday,' said his American soldier companion.
'You should be going to church.'</p>

<p>"An elevation of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"'The same thing,' said the native.</p>

<p>"The show at the theatre that day, by the way, was
given by an American troupe that has been touring the
Indies.</p>

<p>"There is, of course, nothing new in the custom in
Catholic countries of giving Sunday mornings to church
and Sunday afternoons to pleasure. In Ponce the merchants
are not willing to close their stores for the religious
observances of the day, but hold that it would be
wholly wrong to mar the hours of pleasure by business
attentions. The stores are all open Sunday mornings as
on other days, but shut tight Sunday afternoons. Vesper
services are all but unknown. There may be a change<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>
regarding services presently. The priests have not been
paid since the arrival of the American army. It was the
Spanish custom to pay them from the customs receipts.
Colonel Hill has refused to give them any money since
he has been in charge of the custom-house, and has told
them that hereafter their people will have to support
them voluntarily. What the people will say to this at
the start it is hard to guess. They may not wholly understand
it. Under existing laws they are taxed for the
support of the church. What their voluntary support of
it will be remains to be seen. Protestants have almost
a clear field for mission work here. The only Protestant
church on the island is at Ponce, and that was opened
on the Sunday after the Americans' arrival, for the first
time, it is said, in ten years.</p>

<p>"The chief service at the cathedral is held at 9 o'clock
Sunday mornings, mass being said hourly from 5 o'clock
until then. At the 9 o'clock service many Americans
drift in. Even the Catholics among the soldiers who
have attended have appeared to drift in rather than go
with the purpose of doing their devotions. It may be
that there seemed something inconsistent in kneeling
before the altar with a row of cartridges girded around
the body. One man crept into the nave behind the seats,
took off his cartridge belt and laid it beside him, and,
kneeling, bowed his head very low, while he joined in
the prayers. When the service was over he carried the
war belt in his hand to the door and there stopped and
buckled it on. Fifty yards from the door a company of
the Nineteenth Infantry was encamped on guard duty in<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>
the principal public square, on one end of which the
cathedral stands.</p>

<p>"While the services were going on late comers of the
native congregation edged their way in at the rear doors,
and, passing round the screen beneath the choir loft,
dropped to their knees on the marble floor, there remaining
until the close. Noticeable among these worshippers
were the old and widowed and the very poor. The last
recked little or not at all of the filthy floor, trailed with
dirt and spotted with tobacco juice. Some of the others
brought with them prayer rugs, even though they were
but ragged strips of carpeting."</p>

<p>The same correspondent has also this to say about
the shops, which is interesting:</p>

<p>"One of the things revealed by a shopping tour is
the absence from the shops of anything distinctly characteristic
of Porto Rico. The tourist has not made the
island a favorite stopping place, and the people seem to
prefer when buying anything not edible to buy foreign-made
articles. The only things that even bore a stamp
indicative of Porto Rico found by several hunters after
curios were fit relics of a Spanish city&mdash;case knives inscribed
"Viva Ponce." Fortunate seekers after mementoes
secured a few of the peculiar native musical instruments
called guiros. It is straining courtesy as well as
language to call them musical instruments, but they are
used by the natives to make what to the natives is music,
and one of them is included in each group of street or
cafe musicians. The instrument is a gourd shaped like
some of our long-necked squashes, hollowed out through<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>
two vents cut in one side, and the surface over half the
perimeter slashed or furrowed so as to offer a file-like
resistance to a metal trident, which is scraped over it
in time to the music made by the guitar, or whatever
other instrument or instruments make up the orchestra.
There are times when the result is suggestive of the
couchee-couchee music and scratching."</p>

<p>For nearly three centuries slavery existed in Porto
Rico, but it was finally abolished by the Spanish Cortes
in March 1873.</p>

<p>The New York Herald in its special correspondence
has much to say about the inhabitants that is of undoubted
interest, and from this article we have culled
considerable that follows. The article in question was
written after the virtual surrender of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>These people have been accustomed to military rule
all their lives, and to withdraw it in toto and tell them
to go in and govern themselves is an experience which
many regard as dangerous. Of a race excitable, with
blood that courses quickly and with wrongs of many
years' standing, the natives are intoxicated with their
freedom. Their delirium has but one course&mdash;revenge&mdash;and
when the entire population is fully awake to the
opportunity offered there may come a break from all restraint,
and then it may be shown that the depletion of
our army was a blunder.</p>

<p>Without the menace of the Spanish soldiery, without
the fear of the Church, and without the guiding hand of
a good American officer and wisely-located American
army of occupation, there may be trouble ahead.<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></p>

<p>With the going of the soldiers comes the influx of
the mercantile classes. Salesmen are arriving in large
numbers and promoters and speculators abound. Everything
is being boosted from its former lethargic tropical
calm. Prices of commodities are rising. Land has
quadrupled in value in the owners' minds, and even the
street gamins now demand twenty-five cents American
money for a single button alleged to be cut from the
coat of a Spanish soldier, which they formerly had
trouble at disposing of at the rate of twelve and one-half
cents per dozen.</p>

<p>These commercial avant couriers are bright, active
'hustlers,' who make the native nabobs gasp at their
breezy ways, but, all the same, these nabobs are pretty
shrewd persons and know how to buy closely.</p>

<p>There is one thing the native merchants have to
learn, and that is to display their goods and wares. Not
a single show window exists, and if some enterprising
Yankee will just tear out the forbidding front of one of
these business houses, replace it with one on the showcase
style and set forth a dazzling array of merchandize,
arranged by the deft hand of the artistic window decorator,
there will be a revolution in trade in this place.</p>

<p>Another portion of the business life to be renovated
is the sugar industry. The crudest system exists for the
transformation of the juice of the cane into the saccharine
crystals of commerce. Machinery so ponderous that
it requires a volume of steam all out of proportion to the
energy actually needed, and wasteful methods in the
extraction of the syrup residue after crystallization,<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>
obtain. Yankee machinery, coupled with Yankee push,
will cause a wonderful difference in the cost of the finished
product.</p>

<p>"At the same time the manner of herding the hangs
on these huge plantations must surely be changed. Such
conditions exist in the quarters that a mere recital
would be unprintable, and from an examination I made
of the quarters of a very large estate I came away ill
mentally and physically."</p>

<p>Members of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals have a great field before them in this island.
The inhabitants are the most cruel in their handling of
beasts of burden and, in fact, of all living creatures below
the grade of mankind that could be imagined.</p>

<p>Oxen and bulls furnish the principal means of merchandise
transportation. They are yoked together with
a huge horn rising upon the neck just back of the horns
and held in place by bandages around the forehead. The
driver carries a goad about five feet in length, in the
end of which is inserted a sharp steel point about one
inch long. This is used so freely that it is common to
see streams of blood running down the sides of the poor
maltreated beasts. Not satisfied with using the sharp
end, the inhuman drivers frequently deliver terrific
blows with the butt across the tender noses of their
charges.</p>

<p>Many an American soldier has knocked down these
cruel drivers for their abuse of the patient beasts, but
the drivers do not improve with the thrashing. The
American military authorities have imported several<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>
American yokes and an effort is to be made to compel
their use instead of the timber of torture which now
obtains.</p>

<p>An author of the last century has this to say about
the Porto Ricans:</p>

<p>"They are well proportioned and delicately organized;
at the same time they lack vigor, are slow and indolent,
possess vivid imaginations, are vain and inconstant,
though hospitable to strangers, and ardent lovers of
liberty."</p>

<p>Referring to the mixture of races, the same author
continues:</p>

<p>"From this variety of mixture has resulted a character
equivocal and ambiguous, but peculiarly Porto
Rican. The heat of the climate has made them lazy, to
which end also the fertility of the soil has conduced;
the solitary life of the country residents has rendered
them morose and disputatious."</p>

<p>A writer of more recent times declares that they are
"affable, generous, hospitable to a fault, loyal to their
sovereign, and will to the last gasp defend their island
from invasion. The fair sex are sweet and amiable,
faithful as wives, loving as sisters, sweethearts and
daughters, ornaments to any society, tasteful in dress,
graceful in deportment, and elegant in carriage. In fact,
visitors from old Spain have frequently remarked their
resemblance to the <i>doncellas</i> of Cadiz, who are world-renowned
for their grace and loveliness."</p>

<p>"The truth is that they all have the Spanish <i>cortesia</i>,"
says Frederick A. Ober, in the Century Magazine,
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>when commenting upon the above opinions, "and
are more like the polite Andalusians of the south of
Spain than the boorish Catalans of the northeast. Even
the lowliest laborer, unless he be one of the four hundred
thousand illiterates, signs his name with a <i>rubrica</i>,
or elaborate flourish and styles himself 'Don,' after
the manner of the Spanish grandees, and the humblest
innkeeper, when receipting a bill, will admit he 'avails
himself with intense pleasure of this occasion for offering
to such a distinguished gentleman the assurance of
his most distinguished consideration!'</p>

<p>"This need not imply affectation, nor even insincerity,
but merely a different conception of the social amenities
from that of the all-conquering American, who, it is to
be hoped, will not treat this foible with the contempt
which, in his superior wisdom, he may think it merits."<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="head">THE DAWN OF FREEDOM.</p>


<p>When the United States declared war against Spain
for the purpose of freeing Cuba from Spanish misrule
under which she had suffered for so long, and also with
the desire to avenge the dastardly blowing up of the
Maine, but little or no thought was given to Porto Rico.
That island was an unknown quantity, but still one
which was destined to play a considerable part in the
near future.</p>

<p>This was in the natural sequence of events. After the
terrible havoc wrought by our navy at Manila and at
Santiago de Cuba, attention was turned toward Porto
Rico.</p>

<p>The feeling became widespread throughout the United
States that the war would fail in its object if Spain were
not driven from the possession of all her colonies in the
West Indies. Even those who in the beginning thought
that the war was unnecessary, gradually came round to
this point of view. It was quite sure that the expulsion
of Spain from the western hemisphere would prevent
the provoking of another war of the same character, and
this desirable result could not be achieved so long as
Spanish rule was maintained in any part of the West
Indies.</p>

<p>The demand for the freeing of Cuba, the possession of<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>
Porto Rico, as well as a protectorate over the Philippines,
was just, and the nation demanded it.</p>

<p>The Boston Herald aptly remarked:</p>

<p>"This may well stand in the place of any exaction of
money. The United States is much too rich to desire to
compel money payment from an exhausted and practically
beggared nationality. Such a course would be belittling
the war in the eyes of the nations of the world,
and it is not at all in accordance with ideas of our own
national dignity. Here is the substantial concession of
Spain, and it involves all and more than all for which
the war was declared."</p>

<p>The invasion of Porto Rico was not commenced until
after the result of the war had been definitely decided.</p>

<p>But the Spaniards with that unfailing belief in
"manana" (to-morrow) behaved like true Orientals, as
they are in part, and acted as if time gained was half-way
toward victory. With scarcely an exception, they
are all indolent and fatalists.</p>

<p>The prime minister, Senor Sagasta, put off everything
with that word which has proved so fatal to Spain,
which undoubtedly precipitated the war, and which was
at the bottom of all Senor Sagasta's policy&mdash;"manana."</p>

<p>It is related that one day in the Cortes, a deputy criticized
the idleness and indolence of Senor Sagasta, and
the latter replied:</p>

<p>"<i>A nadie le ha sucedido nado por no hacer nada.</i>"</p>

<p>A free translation of this is: "Nothing happens to
him who does nothing."</p>

<p>Both Sagasta and the Spaniards have doubtless found<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>
out by this time the falsity of the saying. To show the
feeling prevailing in Spain, it may be well to quote a
Madrid corresponded of the London Times:</p>

<p>"Though peace is regarded as assured, it may not be
attained so quickly as is generally expected. Senor
Sagasta objects to be hustled, and insists upon everything
being done in a quiet, orderly and dignified manner.
He considers it necessary to have full and satisfactory
explanations as to all doubtful points, in order to
enable him best to protect the national interests against
the aggressive tendencies of the Washington Cabinet.</p>

<p>"He has also to examine very minutely the exigencies
of the internal situation and home politics, so as to
avoid popular dissatisfaction and political unrest. The
Spanish people, though sincerely desirous of peace, are
disposed to admire this hesitancy and tenacious holding
out till the last, although aware that it implies greater
sacrifices.</p>

<p>"As an illustration of this feeling, while General
Toral is blamed for capitulating at Santiago, Captain-General
Augustin, in continuing a hopeless resistance
at Manila, bids fair to be a popular hero."</p>

<p>About this time, before any attack by the Americans,
Macias, captain-general of Porto Rico, discovered a conspiracy,
which if it had not been quickly checked would
have placed the island in a state of insurrection.</p>

<p>Eduardo Baselge and Danian Castillo, both prominent
Porto Ricans, were active leaders in the incipient insurrection.</p>

<p>The Spanish postal authorities discovered the <a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>conspiracy
through a letter written by Castillo to Baselga.
General Macias was informed of this discovery, and a
quiet investigation disclosed the fact that there were
involved in it all of the most prominent residents of the
city of San Juan, both native and foreign.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the conspirators were located
and a quantity of dynamite, arms and provisions was
found.</p>

<p>It was the intention of the leaders, after their plans
had been perfected, to give wide publication to a proclamation
calling upon all native and patriotic Porto
Ricans who hold liberty dearer than life, to join them
and accomplish the overthrow of the Spanish government
and the death of the governor and his officials.
The plans of the conspirators were so carefully laid that
had it not been for the accidental discovery of Castillo's
letter, they would unquestionably have been carried out.</p>

<p>The discovery of the conspiracy occurred about the
time of the visit to Washington of Dr. J. J. Henna and
Ramon Todd, both prominent Porto Ricans, of whom
we have had occasion to speak before, and whose purpose
in going there was to hold a conference with President
McKinley relative to the establishment of a provisional
United States government in the island after the
Spaniards had been driven out.</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours after the arrest the two
leaders, Baselga and Castillo, were shot.</p>

<p>The residents became very much excited over the
affair, and feeling against the Spanish officials ran high.</p>

<p>From the very beginning the real Porto Ricans, as we<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>
shall see hereafter, were in favor of the Americans.
The Spaniards, however, were most bitter, and as
had been the case in Havana and Manila, kept up an
absurd show of superior strength. This is well manifested
by a proclamation which, signed by Jose Reyes,
Celestins Dominguez and Genara Cautino, was issued
to the people of Guayama on May 20, 1898. As one of
the curiosities of the war, it can only be compared to
the celebrated and laughable manifesto which Captain-General
Augustin issued at Manila just before the appearance
of Admiral Dewey's fleet.</p>

<p>The Porto Rican proclamation ran as follows:</p>

<p class="top5">"To the people of Guayama. Hurra for Spain!</p>

<p>"A nation that is our enemy, by its history, by its
race, and because she is the principal cause of our misfortunes
in Cuba, having fomented in this island that
is our sister a war in which she supplied all kinds of resources,
taking away at last the mask with which she
concealed her fictitious friendship, has excited us to-day
to vowed war.</p>

<p>"There is a deep abyss between the manner of being
of that people and ours, which established antagonism
that we should never be able to remove. Our sonorous
language, our habits, the religion of our ancestors, and
our necessities are conditions of our life so different from
those of that race, so opposite to those of that people,
that we are frightened in thinking that we should be
constrained to accept a manner of being that is repugnant
to our origin, our heart and our feelings. We are a
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>people entirely Spanish, and we were born to a civilized
life under a flag that was, and we hope ever will be, that
of our wives and children. For four hundred years the
warmth of the mother of our native country has given
life to our organisms, ideas to our brains, majestic
thoughts to our souls, and generous undertakings to
our hearts, and in those four centuries the glories of the
Spanish house have been our glories, her gayeties our
gayeties, and her misfortunes our own misfortunes.</p>

<p>"We have been full of haughtiness when, being considered
as the Conqueror's sons, we know that we had
participation in the heroic actions of our brothers, and
that the laurels with which they crowned their hero's
front were also our laurels. When in tranquil hours
we heard in our hearths our predecessors' epopee, describing
as superfluously exact their achievements;
giving them lively color that always inspires our tropical
fancy, our nerves felt the thrill produced by enthusiasm;
at those moments, our being all affected, our
breast with its strong aspirations and our fiery tears
rolling down the cheeks reminded us, obliging the cords
of patriotism to vibrate, that we were Spaniards, and
we neither could nor would like any other thing than
to remain Spaniards.</p>

<p>"As if it could be that the country of Sergeant Diaz,
of Andino, and Vascarrondo's, and all those conspicuous
countrymen that irrigated with their blood Martin
Pena and Rio Piedras camps could measure either the
vigor or the haughtiness of an enemy who has not yet
exhibited his face after so many ostentatious and angry
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>vociferations. No! and thousand times no! The light
fishermen of Porto Rico's shores, merchants, lawyers,
musicians, mechanics, journeymen, all persons who
may have strength to grasp a gun must ask for it. All
united, with a solid front we shall go to intercept the
invader. Behind us and as a reserve legion will come
down from the highlands like a raging storm, if it is
necessary, the <i>jibaros</i>, our fields' brothers, the most
accomplished exemplar of abstinence, probity and bravery;
the same that formed the urban militia; the same
that were sent to Santo Domingo to defend gentile
honor; they, who in number of more than 16,000, covered
the plains of the north shore of the island, and
compelled the Englishmen in 1797 to re-embark hastily,
leaving their horses and artillery park.</p>

<p>"Porto Ricans! the moment is rising when not a single
man of this country gives a step backwards, as it is
said commonly; the hour of organizing ourselves for
defense is sounded. The Spanish lion has shaken his
dishevelled mane, and our duties calls us around him.
Our temper is to fight, and we shall fight. Our fate is to
overpower, and we shall overpower. Honor imposes
upon us the obligation of saving home, and we shall
save it in this land of our loves. Before North American
people carry their boldness so far as to tread our sea-coasts
it is necessary that we must be ready to receive
them; that they may find in every Porto Rican an inexorable
enemy, in every heart a rock, in each arm a
weapon to drive them away; that that people feels
that here it is detested intensely, and that Porto Rica's
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>spirit is Spanish, and she will ever be so; therefore,
inhabitants of Guayama, we invite you for a meeting at
the Town House next Tuesday and offer our kind offices
to the government, who will give us arms.</p>

<p>"It would be unworthy of our so gentle history, we
should deny our blood, if in these moments of struggle
we should endure indifferently. Let our enemies know
that we are a brave people, and that if we are soft in
peace days, we are also fit for war chances; that all his
command, all his pride, and all his arrogance may fall
out with a wall composed of all Porto Rican breasts."</p>

<p>In the light of ulterior and posterior events, this
document is really as comical as anything in opera-bouffe.</p>

<p>"We have no means of knowing," says the New
York Sun, in commenting upon this precious effusion,
"whether Senor Jose Reyes, Senor Celestino Dominguez
and Senor Genaro Cautino actually grasped
their guns and immolated themselves upon the altar of
four centuries and in the presence of the ostentatious
and vociferous invader; or whether they prudently
joined the light fishermen, merchants, lawyers, musicians
and <i>jibaros</i> of Porto Rico, to whom they had
vainly appealed in the name of Spain in yelling themselves
hoarse as the Stars and Stripes went up in town
after town. Perhaps they took the latter course. Perhaps
they will turn out good Americans. In Porto
Rico, as elsewhere, times change, and men's minds
change with the changes of time and destiny."<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="head">NAVAL LESSONS TAUGHT BY THE WAR.</p>


<p>After the remarkable victory at Santiago de Cuba,
where Admiral Cervera's fleet, which attempted to steal
out of the harbor, with the loss of but one man on the
American side, Admiral Sampson, with a portion of his
fleet, proceeded to San Juan in Porto Rico. This city he
bombarded, directing his principal fire against Morro
Castle.</p>

<p>What followed bears strong testimony to the remarkable
gunnery of our "jackies."</p>

<p>Morro Castle and the buildings on the high ground
in its rear were simply riddled. Great holes were in
places blown out by our large shells and the walls were
pitted by the hail of the smaller ones.</p>

<p>There was one entire building which was blown to
pieces, and a whole section of the Cuartel was laid in
ruins. To be sure, many of our shells were wasted in
the sea wall, but this is not to be wondered at, as the
parapet had embrasures for guns, and from where our
ships were lying, these would naturally be mistaken for
a sea battery.</p>

<p>Neither in Morro Castle nor in the more pretentious
fortifications known as San Cristobal, were there any
great number of modern guns. There were a few Krupp
guns, but the remainder consisted of muzzleloaders of
an ancient pattern; most of the latter were mounted<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>
upon parapets of masonry. It may be said that the defences
of San Juan were opposed to every theory of
modern military science. The defenses might have been
considered impregnable some fifty years or so ago, but
to-day they are by no means formidable.</p>

<p>Our marvelous naval victories have taught a lesson to
the entire world, and America to-day stands stronger
than she ever did before. In fact, there is not a nation
that does not respect us and fear us, which possibly
could not have been said before the American-Spanish
war. Prior to that, it was rather the fashion to sneer at
the Yankee army and navy, but that will never be done
again.</p>

<p>Foreign nations know now what the United States
really is.</p>

<p>"Dewey's and Sampson's victories must be very depressing
to French, German and Russian naval aspirations,"
observes a gentleman of Washington, who is a
most competent authority. "For years they have been
measuring up against England, and quietly calculating
what combinations they could make to overthrow British
sea power. France, particularly, has been building
a navy which she hoped, in spite of past experience,
might cope with England's. She has spent immense
sums upon it, and relative to the interests it has to
guard, it is larger and stronger than England's. But
Spain's experience reiterates the old story that it is not
so much the ships as the men on them who win victories.
Had the Americans been on Spanish ships and
the Spanish on the American there would have been a<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>
very different story to tell. While the French are very
superior to the Spanish, they are of the same Latin
blood, and there is just enough similiarity between the
two peoples to hint at the success French ships would
have in encountering with Anglo-Saxons, either sailing
under the Star Spangled Banner or the Cross of St.
George. Germany is likely to have the same sort of a
chill. The Gentians have never been a maritime nation.
A German war vessel has never fired a hostile shot, and
Germans may well have solicitous thoughts as to the
result of a struggle with men who have shown themselves
past masters in the art of naval warfare. Russia is
in the same situation. She has never actually fought
anybody at sea but the Turks. The wiser among these
peoples are very likely to begin thinking that their
dreams of sea power are vain illusions, and that they
had better save the money they have been spending on
navies and resign the dominion of the sea to the English-speaking
races."</p>

<p>There is no doubt that our naval victories have
taught many and valuable lessons, and it is perhaps
proper to make a slight digression here and show what
some of these lessons are.</p>

<p>Let us then consider the deliberations of a board of
naval officers, some of the ablest experts in the service,
appointed by Admiral Sampson, after the battle of Santiago
de Cuba, to report upon the condition of Cervera's
sunken fleet, the extent of damages done by American
shells and the lessons to be learned therefrom to guide
the United States in its future ship construction.<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></p>

<p>The conclusions reached by the board were as follows:</p>

<p>The use of wood in the construction and equipment of
war ships should be reduced to the utmost minimum
possible.</p>

<p>Loaded torpedoes above the water line are a serious
menace to the vessels carrying them, and they should not
be so carried by vessels other than torpedo boats.</p>

<p>The value of rapid-fire batteries cannot be too highly
estimated.</p>

<p>All water and steam pipes should be laid beneath the
protective deck and below the water line and fitted
with risers at such points as may be considered necessary.</p>

<p>The board also found that the ships Infanta Maria
Teresa, Almirante Oquendo and Viscaya were destroyed
by conflagration, caused by the explosion of shells in
the interior, which set fire to the woodwork. The upper
deck and all other woodwork on their ships was entirely
consumed except the extremities. This shows the importance
of fireproofing all woodwork on board ships.</p>

<p>Many of the guns on board the burned ships were
found loaded at the time of the board's visit, indicating
the haste with which the crews were driven from the
guns.</p>

<p>With talks with experts the following was developed
as to what the war showed:</p>

<p>First&mdash;That the gun is still the dominating factor in
war.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;That rapid-fire guns are especially valuable,
but that it is advisable to retain guns of large calibres.<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></p>

<p>Third&mdash;That smokeless powder is absolutely essential
for modern warfare.</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;That there should be a great reduction in the
amount of woodwork on board ship and that that left on
board should be fireproof, some going so far as to say
that woodwork should be eliminated entirely, its place
to be taken by some other substance.</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;That armor should be distributed over the entire
ship rather than be limited to the section where its
vitals are located.</p>

<p>Sixth&mdash;That monitors are useless for cruising purposes
or for fighting in rough waters.</p>

<p>Seventh&mdash;That the United States should have a larger
navy, with speedier battleships and fast armored
cruisers, and with coaling stations in different sections
of the globe, where men-of-war can procure supplies
and make repairs if necessary.</p>

<p>Captain Charles O'Neil, chief of the bureau of
ordnance, gave his opinion as follows:</p>

<p>"I do not think the battle off Santiago de Cuba demonstrated
that we should abandon the heavy calibres of
guns. Serious injury to an enemy's thickly-armored
battleships can be inflicted only by large-calibre guns.</p>

<p>"It is possible that with rapid-fire guns you may
shoot away the lightly armored superstructure, but as
long as the vitals are protected and the turret armor is
intact the guns in the turret will be able to do execution,
and large-calibred guns will be necessary to perforate
the armor and disable those weapons. Even with
her 12-inch guns the Texas can fire at the rate of one<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>
round per minute, and this record is as good as that
made by any foreign ships. Rapid fire consists in good
facilities for handling ammunition and loading the gun
with a quick working breech mechanism.</p>

<p>"We are now building at the Washington gun factory
an experimental 6-inch rapid-fire gun, different from
the rapid-fire guns we have now in service, which are
supplied with what is termed fixed ammunition. The
powder and projectile to be used in the experimental
gun will be separate, and two operations consequently
will have to be employed in loading. This can be done
so quickly that it is expected that a very rapid fire will
be obtained.</p>

<p>"It is the policy of the Department to have our ships
a little ahead of those of any other nation, to have
them equipped with armor of greater resistive power,
and guns capable of doing more execution. The 13-inch
gun, as at present designed, is a more destructive gun
than a 12-inch ordinarily, and its energy is very much
greater, the result naturally being that it has superior
armor-piercing powers.</p>

<p>"I think we should keep the 13-inch gun on board of
our battleships. On account of the light armor which
protected the Spanish men-of-war, it is difficult to compare
the ships and the effect of their fire, or to draw
conclusions. We would have learned more if the Spanish
fleet had been made up of battleships, and the fire
of their gunners had been more accurate. As it is, the
value of the secondary battery was certainly demonstrated.<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></p>

<p>"The necessity of eliminating wood to the greatest
extent possible and fireproofing what remains, was
shown by the destruction of the Spanish men-of-war.
Fire mains should be kept below the protective deck.
The battle proved that ships moving rapidly can attack
other vessels also under way and inflict serious injury.</p>

<p>"The excellent gunnery of the American sailors is
entirely due to the practice which they had undergone,
but the target fired at was stationary, while their ship
was moving. The conditions were different in action.
The Spanish were under way, yet the American gunners
fired as well as if they were merely practising."</p>

<p>The New York Herald speaks as follows of our naval
victories:</p>

<p>"Ramming, that expedient of despair, was not attempted.
Torpedoing, despite the opportunities afforded,
was estopped by the quick service of rapid-fire guns on
board an inferior but superbly handled construction,
and that final effort, a 'charge through,' was never
allowed to challenge the combined energies of our fleet.
If audacity could have merited success, these Spaniards
deserved much, but here the marrow of the war
proverb was not with them.</p>

<p>"Pitted against similar ships, even in superior numbers,
some of the fleeing cruisers might have slipped
seaward in hot haste for the breaking of the Havana
blockade. Failing that, all might have concentrated an
assault upon certain selected vessels and found consolation
for final defeat in the foundering hulls of their
enemy. But audacity did not count, individual bravery<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>
went for naught; because, while heavier constructions
barred the way, and superior guns smashed the pathways
of escape, energized skill overcame untrained courage
and patient discipline crushed unorganized effort.</p>

<p>"The battleships not only fought the armored cruisers
in a long, stern chase down the shore, but destroying as
they ran, finally forced them blazing in their own wrecks
upon a hostile coast. The torpedo boat destroyers engaged
single handed by the Gloucester succumbed so
quickly to inferior armament and speed that their value
in a day attack, or, indeed, their value at any time save
as weapons of surprise, need no longer be reckoned
with. This will be a rude awakening to the zealots
who had seen in this weapon the downfall of the ship of
the fighting line, but it will be a heart-cheering confirmation
to the loyal seamen who in season and out
have never ceased to proclaim that the integrity of sea
nations rests on battleships and the well-served guns of
a fleet."</p>

<p>"I think sometimes if it had not been for the work of
the Oregon the Colon might have got away," was the
statement made by an admiral on the retired list. "I
am not sure that the Brooklyn, with all her speed, could
have stopped the Colon, but I think it quite likely that
the New York would have finally overtaken the Colon
and stopped her."</p>

<p>More emphasis was laid upon the speed of the Oregon
and the closeness of her position than upon her 13-inch
shells, one of which played such havoc. The admiral
was not seemingly impressed with the difference in<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>
effectiveness between the guns of large and small calibre,
but continued to lay stress on the admirable speed of
the Oregon.</p>

<p>"But," he continued, "the war has proved nothing
so far as the navy is concerned. The Spaniards showed
no enterprise. If we had come up against the navy of
England there would have been some basis for a conclusion,
but shooting in the air, as the Spaniards did,
proves nothing. They had a fine fleet, with most modern
equipment, and yet they could kill only one man in the
whole encounter."</p>

<p>Admiral Sir George Elliot, of the British Navy, considers
that at least five important lessons have been
taught by the war. His opinions are as follows:</p>

<p>"First, in state of peace be fully prepared for war in
every respect; second, the value of adequately-protected
coaling stations; third, the value of superior speed for
the cruiser class, and especially for the more weakly-armored
vessels; fourth, the naval defense of seaports
by gunboats and the raising of the naval volunteer
corps as an integral portion of the naval reserve forces;
fifth, that great importance be attached to a steady gun
platform for quick-firing guns, looking to the small
number of hits compared with numerous shots fired.</p>

<p>"In this connection," said Sir George Elliot, "I
am informed that the Americans are likely to adopt
Captain Hodgett's form of bottom for their new ships,
which must give greater steadiness than bilge keels."</p>

<p>Admiral Sir Henry Nicholson, who was captain of
the Temeraire at the bombardment of Alexandria, and<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>
has since been commander in chief at the Cape of Good
Hope and at the Nore, has spoken thus:</p>

<p>"This war has taught us nothing. The state of the
Spanish navy has been for years so hopelessly rotten
that when the moment for action arrived its military
value was nil. The Spanish gunners hardly seem to have
got a hit in on any American ship. Nothing is taught
us as to the relative value of the belt or deck armor."</p>

<p>As regards ships versus forts, he said:</p>

<p>"The Spanish forts seem to have been, probably from
various reasons, as inefficient as their ships. Both the
Spaniards and the Americans in their use of torpedo
craft have shown very remarkable absence of dash.
Practically neither side has made any use of this
dreaded arm."</p>

<p>Captain Montagu Burrow, who is professor of modern
history at the University of Oxford, had this opinion
to offer:</p>

<p>"There are no new lessons to be learned, but only
confirmation of some that are very old. The state of
unreadiness in Spain when the war suddenly broke out
might, from the unfortunate circumstances of that
country, have been expected, but if the United States
had had to deal with a Power anything like its own
strength it would have found its own position intensely
difficult. The war will probably have the effect of inducing
their government to keep up a standing army
and navy of a very superior kind to that of their present
system. The recent warning of their admirable writer,
Captain Mahau, will now have a chance of being<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>
listened to, but the Americans have only to expand
what is already proved to be good. The training of
their officers and men must have been of a superior kind
to enable them to handle their ships and point their
guns with such excellent effect. It was at one time considered
doubtful whether modern guns could be as accurately
fired at great distances as the old armament at
shorter ranges, but they were laid quite as accurately,
and were far more destructive."</p>

<p>As the New York Herald declared at the time, the
United States had now attained their majority. They
were now of age, and their voice must be heard in the
council of nations.</p>

<p>There were misgivings all over Europe, especially in
Germany and France, old and bitter foes though they
are.</p>

<p>A prominent Parisian thus summed up these misgivings:</p>

<p>"The young American giant," he said, "is only trying
his strength on Spain, but what if he should use it
against us?"<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="head">WHAT OUR ARMY ACHIEVED.</p>


<p>Now to turn from the navy to the army, and see what
the latter achieved in Porto Rico.</p>

<p>On July 21, 1898, General Miles sailed from Guantanamo
Bay with a force of 3,415 men. General Wilson
had sailed the day before from Charleston with 4,000
men, and General Schwan and his command sailed from
Port Tampa two days later.</p>

<p>The entire army of invasion numbered about eleven
thousand men.</p>

<p>The hardships on the transports were very great.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts carried three troops of cavalry
from New York and Pennsylvania to Porto Rico and the
events of the voyage have been thus narrated by an eye-witness:</p>

<p>"With the penetrating of the tropics come days of
languor and nights of inactivity so delicious it seems
profanation to move. More than one thousand men, who
boarded the Massachusetts with the vigor of the North
in their veins, have succumbed, one by one, to the
lethargy of the soft breeze of the Bahamas.</p>

<p>But an awakening is at hand. Pumps that have been
running steadily day and night slow down and stop.
Troopers had become so accustomed to the quick beating
of the smaller machines that the cessation of throbs
between the slower pulsations of the heavier engines is<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>
noticed instantly. A quick inquiry as to the cause
brings the answer from one less well-informed: "Only
the water pumps broken down." That is all, only eleven
hundred parched horses awaiting the answer to the
bugle call they had learned so well&mdash;"Water horses!"&mdash;which
sounded at the moment of the fatal break in the
pumps. Only a transport carrying ten hundred and
thirty men, and no means of extinguishing a fire!</p>

<p>Twenty minutes; one-half hour, and Captain Read,
who has gone down into "the hole," asks for five Troop
A men. "No hurry," so the order said. Somebody
knew better, and the troopers go, hand over hand, down
into the ship's hold. A few bales of hay come up and
over the side of the ship, and sizzle as they strike the
water. The troopers nurse a few burned fingers, and
Captain Read reappears on deck, smoked, wet with perspiration,
and makes his usual answer to a question,
"What's the trouble?" with "Nothing at all." But
five men of Troop A and Captain Read knows that a
dangerous fire has been extinguished for the third time
in one day with men's bare hands.</p>

<p>"Three-quarters of an hour, and no sound from the engine-room,
except the steady throb of the propeller.</p>

<p>"'Thirty men from Troop A, thirty men from City
Troop, and thirty men from Troop C!' and ninety men
in three squads silently are lined around that entrance
to Hades&mdash;the hole. 'Another fire,' was the quick
alarm, but it was worse than that. 'Water! water!
water!" the cry comes from the sunken eyes that look
pleadingly at men; from harsh breathing; from parched<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>
throats; from hanging heads of eleven hundred horses
and mules that had not been watered since receiving a
scant quart eighteen hours before. 'Let's see,' said the
United States cavalrymen, quietly, 'the pumps are
hopeless, but we can draw up one bucketful every minute
from the hold aft, and one every minute from the forward
hatch. We ought to water all in ten hours. Form
lines and water solid. The horse you skip will be dead
in the morning.'</p>

<p>"The horses stand with swollen legs far apart, instinctively
to prevent a fall. Once down, they know
they never can get up. Their heads hang low and their
breathing comes in a whistle from parched lungs
through a long, dry throat and dusty mouth. There is
an occasional form in the black galleys. It is some
trooper, his big arms around the neck of his beloved
dying mount, with tears in his eyes, but petting and
talking to the animal as if it understood. Then ropes
over blocks begin to draw buckets of water from sixty
feet below. Immediately each horse or mule has its
draught, it is bathed in perspiration, and skin dry and
shriveled becomes soft and pliable. One can feel in the
dark, whether a horse has been missed or not.</p>

<p>"There is a delay and an anxious inquiry from above:
'What's the matter?' 'Haul away,' is the response, and
the bucket comes heavy this time. Oh, it's only a man,
stark naked, fainting, with a rope beneath his arms,
and head away to one side. 'Hospital case, overcome,
haul away,' and another bucket swings upward."</p>

<p>Of course the objective point of the whole campaign<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>
was the capital, San Juan, on the northeastern coast of
the island. Nevertheless the troops were mostly landed
on the southern coast not far from the southwestern
corner. The plan was to drive all the Spanish troops
upon the island into San Juan, where they could be captured
upon the surrender of that city.</p>

<p>The Spaniards abandoned precipitately the whole
southern coast line, and this seemed to promise an easy
march for the Americans across Porto Rico.</p>

<p>But this was not exactly the case, as we shall proceed
to demonstrate.</p>

<p>There were several causes why the Spaniards fled before
the invading Americans.</p>

<p>One was that in the beginning the Spanish forces,
from lack of knowledge as to where the Americans
would land, were widely scattered. By retreating, the
coast garrisons were brought together in bodies of more
or less magnitude. More than this in the interior could
be found stronger positions for defense, and there only
land forces would have to be dealt with.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Spaniards in Porto Rico, knowing
as they must have, that the war was virtually over,
hoped by a show of resistance at the end to come out
with a certain degree of credit, and had resolved to give
up the fight only when they received an order to do so
from Madrid.</p>

<p>At all events, the Spanish troops disputed the American
advance at several points. At Fajardo the American
forces raised the Stars and Stripes, but the Spaniards,
several hundred in number, pulled it down and even<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>
sought to drive away the landing party that held the
lighthouse on the shore. This attempt was most manifestly
absurd, as in the harbor was a squadron, consisting
of the monitor Amphitrite, the protected cruiser
Cincinnati and the Leyden. No time was lost in landing
men to support the lighthouse force, and to open
fire from the ships. The Spaniards were driven back
and suffered much from their foolish temerity.</p>

<p>In the beginning the plan of campaign included an
advance along three lines.</p>

<p>The first division, under General Schwan, was to advance
along the western coast to Aguadilla, in the north-western
corner of the island, and then to push to the
east until Arecibo, on the northern coast and about half-way
between Aguadilla and San Juan, was reached.
The second division, under General Henry, was to push
directly to the north from Ponce, forming a union with
Schwan at Arecibo. The main advance was to be along
the military road from Ponce to San Juan. As this road
runs for some distance parallel to the southern coast, a
division was dispatched under General Brooke to land
at Arroyo and capture Guayama, an important city on
the military road, about forty miles east of Ponce. By
this means, whatever detachments of Spanish troops
might be stationed on the road between these two
points were exposed to attack from both front and
rear.</p>

<p>Before any of these movements could be completed,
however, came the armistice and the consequent cessation
of hostilities.<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></p>

<p>Much, though, had been accomplished before this,
enough to show what American arms were capable of.</p>

<p>In the east, General Brooke, after landing at Arroyo,
had taken Guayama; in the centre, General Wilson had
advanced on the military road, occupied Coamo, and
had made a demonstration before Aibonito, where there
was a large Spanish force; further to the west, General
Henry had marched to within fifteen miles of Arecibo;
in the extreme west, General Schwan had marched along
the coast and taken Mayaguez, the principal port in that
end of the island, after a sharp skirmish with a force
that outnumbered his own. The slight opposition met
by General Brooke at Guayama, General Wilson at
Coamo, and General Schwan near Mayaguez, indicated
that there would be little difficulty in reaching the capital,
and officers and men alike felt that the capture of
San Juan was a matter of but a few days.</p>

<p>The third landing of American troops in Porto Rico
took place on August 2, at Arroyo, from the St. Louis
and the St. Paul. The army then took the place of the
navy and accepted the surrender of the town. There
was no defense and no Spanish flag was flying. The
surrender of Arroyo was important, as there were a
large number of manufacturing enterprises there.</p>

<p>The attitude of the civil authorities and the ineffective
character of the defense made by the Spanish
troops, says the San Francisco Argonaut, was illustrated
by the advance made by General Henry's division.
General Roy Stone was sent in advance with a small
body of about one hundred men to reconnoiter the road<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>
and determine its fitness for military operations. The
character of the expedition may be gathered from the
fact that General Stone and his officers rode in carriages.
Yet town after town surrendered to these outposts until
they were encamped before Arecibo, on the northern
coast of the island. The main body had nothing to do
but follow and furnish flags for the surrendered municipalities.</p>

<p>One of the most extraordinary things in the whole
campaign was the surrender of the city of Ponce. This
was done in response to a telephone communication from
Ensign Curtin. Not a single shot was fired.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Ponce it was reported that a
large Spanish force had gathered about ten miles in the
interior. Two companies of soldiers were sent out by
General Ernst to see what this meant. On the outskirts
of the town a party of Spanish soldiers, loaded down
with guns and swords, was met with. As soon as the
Spaniards caught sight of the Americans they ran
toward them crying, "Don't shoot!"</p>

<p>They declared that they were coming in to surrender.
Although the party was small, they had arms enough to
stock a regiment. They were taken before General Wilson,
gave up their arms and signed a parole.</p>

<p>There was quite a strong resistance made at Coamo, a
town on the main military road between Juana Diaz and
the Spanish mountain stronghold at Aibonito. General
Wilson effected the capture of this place with the most
consummate skill. His plan was simple enough. It was
nothing more nor less than an ordinary flank movement,<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>
such as Grant and Sherman used so successfully during
the Civil War.</p>

<p>General Wilson advanced against the town on the
main road with sufficient infantry, cavalry and artillery
to drive out the Spanish garrison. But when the latter
attempted to retreat they found their way blacked by
the Sixteenth Pennsylvania, under Colonel Hulings,
which General Wilson had sent round to the rear of the
town the night before.</p>

<p>The attack in front was timed so as to allow this force
to get into position.</p>

<p>The Battle of Coamo, if indeed, it can be so called,
for it was nothing more than a lively skirmish, has been
thus described:</p>

<p>"Just as darkness fell, the regiment left the military
road and struck at a right angle for the hills to the
northward. Porto Rican guides led the way over paths
so rough and narrow that the men could move only in
single file. It was toilsome progress. Absolute silence
was enjoined; no smoking was permitted lest the fitful
flash of a match should betray the movement to the
watchful Spaniards on the hills. For hours the men
toiled on. The officers were compelled to walk and lead
their horses. Creeks and rivulets were waded; lofty
hills were climbed or skirted; yawning ravines were
crossed. The men dripped with perspiration, although
the night air was chilly.</p>

<p>"At dawn both General Wilson and General Ernest
were in the saddle, and long before the shadows lifted
from the valleys the main body of the army was in <a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>motion
to drive the enemy out of the town and into Hulling's
net. Nearer than the village and off to the right
was the blockhouse of Llamo de Coamo. The blockhouse
was the first place attacked. There was a heavy,
jarring rumble over the macadam of the military road.
Anderson's battery came along at a sharp trot. At a
turn in the road where the blockhouse came into view it
halted. Two minutes later the fight opened. For a few
minutes the Spanish returned the fire with Mausers, but
as shell after shell crashed through the blockhouse, they
abandoned it and fell back toward Coamo. Soon flames
leaped upward from the roof, and an hour later the fort
was but a smoldering ruin.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the infantry was pressing rapidly forward.
General Wilson was wondering what had become of
Hulings. Not a warlike sound came from the village, a
mile and a half away. Had the garrison escaped? Suddenly
from beyond the town came the rattle of musketry.
Soon the sound swelled into a steady roar, which
the mountains echoed again and again."</p>

<p>The same writer tells a story in regard to one whom
he terms a real hero of the war, and he calls attention to
the callous manner in which Spanish soldiers were sacrificed
to protect political adventurers at home. To
quote his own words:</p>

<p>"His name was Don Rafael Martinez. There was no
military justification for attempting to hold Coamo
under the circumstances. Yet Major Martinez stayed.
He was still in the prime of youth and in fine health.
In Spain his family is aristocratic and influential, and<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>
could have protected him from the consequences of a
quixotic court-martial. Martinez knew that resistance
was utterly hopeless. But Colonel San Martian had
been practically disgraced by Governor-General Macias
for evacuating Ponce, and all commanders of garrisons
in the path of the American army were ordered to fight.
So Major Martinez kissed his young wife and children
good-by one day last week and sent them into San Juan
for safety. His scouts brought word that an American
column of double the garrison's strength was slowly
creeping around to his rear. Then Martinez knew that he
was trapped, and decided to go out and meet the enemy.
He rode in advance of his slender column until he
sighted Hulings's men, who were immediately apprised
of the enemy's presence by a volley. Soon bullets were
flying like hail. Martinez, mounted upon a gray horse,
rode up and down in front of his troops, uttering encouraging
words. The soldier's death which Martinez
sought was not long coming. For a while he reeled in
his saddle, maintaining his seat with evident difficulty.
Then his horse went to his knees, and Martinez slowly
slid from the saddle, a lifeless form. When Major Martinez
was found, five wounds, three of which were mortal,
were discovered. His horse was shot in four places."</p>

<p>The result of the attack on Coamo was the capture of
about one hundred and eighty men, or most of the garrison
except the cavalry who took to the mountains by
paths better known to them than to the Americans. Of
General Wilson's force, none was killed and only a few
were wounded.<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></p>

<p>The whole affair was splendidly managed. As has
been said before, all General Miles's plans could be put
into action, the war was practically ended.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of August 12, Secretary of State Day
and M. Cambou, the French ambassador, who was representing
Spain, affixed their signatures to duplicate
copies of a protocol establishing a basis upon which the
two countries, acting through their respective commissioners,
could negotiate terms of peace.</p>

<p>The provisions of the protocol were practically as
follows:</p>

<p>1. That Spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty
over and title to Cuba.</p>

<p>2. That Porto Rico and other Spanish islands in the
West Indies, and an island in the Ladrones, to be selected
by the United States, shall be ceded to the latter.</p>

<p>3. That the United States will occupy and hold the
city, bay and harbor of Manila, pending the conclusion
of a treaty of peace which shall determine the control,
disposition and government of the Philippines.</p>

<p>4. That Cuba, Porto Rico and other Spanish islands in
the West Indies shall be immediately evacuated, and that
commissioners, to be appointed within ten days, shall,
within thirty days from the signing of the protocol,
meet at Havana and San Juan respectively, to arrange
and execute the details of the evacuation.</p>

<p>5. That the United States and Spain will each appoint
not more than five commissioners to negotiate and conclude
a treaty of peace. The commissioners are to meet
at Paris not later than October.<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></p>

<p>6. On the signing of the protocol, hostilities will be
suspended and notice to that effect will be given as soon
as possible by each Government to the commanders of
its military and naval forces.</p>

<p>The President at once signed the following proclamation,
declaring an armistice:</p>

<p>"By the President of the United States of America:</p>

<p class="head">"A PROCLAMATION.</p>

<p>"Whereas, By a protocol concluded and signed
August 12, 1898, by William R. Day, Secretary of State
of the United States, and his Excellency Jules Cambon,
Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the
republic of France at Washington, respectively representing
for this purpose the Government of the United
States and the Government of Spain, the United States
and Spain have formally agreed upon the terms on
which negotiations for the establishment of peace between
the two countries shall be undertaken; and,</p>

<p>"Whereas, It is in said protocol agreed that upon its
conclusion and signature hostilities between the two
countries shall be suspended, and that notice to that
effect shall be given as soon as possible by each government
to the commanders of its military and naval forces;</p>

<p>"Now, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of
the United States, do, in accordance with the stipulations
of the protocol, declare and proclaim on the part of
the United States a suspension of hostilities, and do
hereby command that orders be immediately Driven
through the proper channels to the commanders of the
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>military and naval forces of the United States to abstain
from all acts inconsistent with this proclamation.</p>

<p>"In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand
and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>"Done at the city of Washington, this 12th day of
August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and ninety-eight, and of the independence of the
United States the one hundred and twenty-third.</p>

<p class="r">"William McKinley.</p>

<p class="top5">"By the President. William R. Day, Secretary of State."</p>

<p>It may be interesting to pause here for a moment and
note what the London press had to say as to this suspension
of hostilities. It will be observed that the comments
were extraordinarily favorable to the United
States.</p>

<p>The Standard, commenting on the signing of the
protocol by the representatives of Spain and the United
States, said: "Thus ends one of the most swiftly decisive
wars in history. Spanish rule disappears from the
West. The conquerors have problems of great difficulty
before them. Doubtless they will face them with patriotic
resolution."</p>

<p>The Daily News said: "August 12, 1898, will be a
memorable day in the history of the world. It is the
day which witnessed the death of one famous empire
and the birth of another, destined perhaps to more enduring
fame. It must be admitted that the results
achieved are a substantial record for four mouths of
war."<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></p>

<p>The Morning Post said that the protocol leaves open
the two questions regarding which future difficulties
that may not concern the United States and Spain alone
are likely to arise. It advises Spain, assuming that the
United States only holds Manila, to sell the Philippines.</p>

<p>The Daily Telegraph was impressed by the indifference
of the bulk of the Spanish nation to the sentiment
of national pride, which seems to be extinct. For this
reason national life, in the true sense of the word, must
sooner or later cease to exist.</p>

<p>The paper discussed the decadence of Spain in connection
with the contention that France and Italy have
become stationary, and predicts the ultimate disappearance
of the Latin race as a factor in the human drama.</p>

<p>The Chronicle said that the American people will
never regret the sacrifices they have made to remove the
Spanish colonies from the map.</p>

<p>It added that many more difficulties and sacrifices
await them, but the result will be the growth of freedom
and the extension of human happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p>The Times said it hoped it was not a violation of
neutrality to express the satisfaction felt by a great majority
of Englishmen at the success of the United States.
It added:</p>

<p>"Historians will wrangle for a long time respecting
the propriety of the methods by which the war was
brought about, but once begun it was eminently desirable
for the interests of the world, and even, perhaps,
ultimately to the interests of Spain herself, that it
should result in the success of the Americans.<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></p>

<p>"The factor in the situation which is of the greatest
immediate importance to ourselves is the fate of the
Philippines."</p>

<p>The Times thought it very remarkable that the New
York newspapers discovered on the same day that the
United States were bound to put themselves in the best
possible position for defending the common interests of
themselves and Great Britain in China. It concluded:</p>

<p>"Providence in the nick of time has given them the
Philippines."</p>

<p>The armistice proclamation was followed at once by
orders from the War Department to the several commanding
generals in the field directing that all military
operations be suspended.</p>

<p>This was the text of the message to General Miles:</p>

<p class="top5 r">"Adjutant-General's Office,<br />
Washington, Aug. 12, 1898.</p>

<p>"Major-General Miles, Ponce, Porto Rico:</p>

<p>"The President directs that all military operations
against the enemy be suspended. Peace negotiations are
nearing completion, a protocol having just been signed
by representatives of the two countries. You will inform
the commander of the Spanish forces in Porto Rico
of these instructions. Further orders will follow.
Acknowledge receipt.</p>

<p>"By order Secretary of War.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 27%;">"H. C. Corbin, Adjutant-General."</span></p>

<p class="top5">These orders, coming as they did, undoubtedly prevented
the sacrifice of many valuable lives before San<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>
Juan. But they were anything but popular among the
American troops, for they reached the various divisions
just as each was about to strike a decisive blow.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, however, it is said, received the news
with loud manifestations of delight.</p>

<p>In General Brook's division, a battery had just been
advanced to position and the order to fire was about to
be given, when a courier, his steed panting and covered
with foam, dashed upon the field and informed the general
that an armistice had been concluded.</p>

<p>General Brooke's sole reply was:</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, you arrived five minutes too soon. You
should have been more considerate of your horse."</p>

<p>While our army did not have a chance to show all
that it was capable of accomplishing, it was proven conclusively
that the Yankees are good and brave fighters.</p>

<p>The sight of an army springing up out of nothing,
the spectacle of the monumental work of military
organization being pushed on to success in spite of mistakes,
arrested the attention of all European nations.</p>

<p>One thing is certain&mdash;a noble victory has been nobly
won; and won, happily at a cost, which, deplorable
though it actually was, was relatively small, as must be
acknowledged by every student of the warfare of the
past.<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="head">HOW THE PORTO RICANS RECEIVED US.</p>


<p>Whatever may have been the attitude and feelings of
the Spanish officials and Spanish troops, there can be no
doubt that the Porto Ricans themselves welcomed most
enthusiastically the advent of the Americans and the
dawn of a new era. The joy manifested at the sight of
invaders in a conquered country was most extraordinary,
and we can affirm with truth that it has no parallel
in history.</p>

<p>It was most fortunate that little or no fighting took
place, as thus many valuable lives were saved. There
was no question whatever as to the result.</p>

<p>The number and location of the Spanish troops on the
island just before the armistice was declared were as
follows:</p>

<p>Aibonito, 1,800 men, and two 4-inch field cannon;
Cavey, 700 men; Caguas, 600; Rio Piedras, 180;
Carolite, 320; Arecibo, 320, and two 4-inch field cannon;
Aguadilla, 320; Crab Island, 100; Bayamon, 395;
San Juan, 1,706, making a total of 5,441, to which may
be added approximately 500 of the Guardia Civil, doing
duty in their own villages all over the island, and 200
of the Orden Publico, doing similar police duty in San
Juan. Many members of the Guardia Civil in or near
the territory held by the American troops joined the
Americans.<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></p>

<p>It cannot be told with any certainty how much resistance
the Spaniards would have offered had hostilities
continued, but most of the fighting would have undoubtedly
taken place within sight of San Juan. The
Spaniards themselves believed this, as the preparations
they made sufficiently indicated.</p>

<p>The native people generally were thoroughly delighted
with the news that the island was likely to be
ceded to the United States. Wherever the American flag
went up, it was cheered with a vigor that probably was
never given to the Spanish flag during all the centuries
it has been in evidence.</p>

<p>Everywhere, the people rushed forward to welcome
the invaders, and showered them with hospitable attentions.
Pretty women dressed themselves in their richest
garments and smiled their sweetest smiles to charm the
conquerors.</p>

<p>Food, cigars and wines were pressed upon the soldiers;
the civil authorities issued florid proclamations over the
glad event of becoming "Americanos," and the whole
country blossomed with Star-Spangled banners. The
only reason why even more of them were not displayed
was because more of them could not be obtained.</p>

<p>It was one of the most unlooked-for and surprising
things of this most surprising war, as a writer in the
National Tribune of Washington observes.</p>

<p>The same writer goes on to say that really there is
good reason for all this.</p>

<p>"The substantial people of Puerto Rico know that it
is immensely to their interest to cut loose from Spain,<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>
and be grafted on to the United States. The greater
part of their trade is with this country, and Spain has
been bleeding them for the privilege of carrying it on.
Now they can send their coffee, sugar, tobacco, tropical
fruits, etc., directly to this market, get American prices
for them, and buy American goods in return at regular
American prices.</p>

<p>"They ought to be mighty glad to get into this country,
but, being Spaniards, we hardly expected them to
have so much sense."</p>

<p>Guanica was the first town taken by our soldiers.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm was unbounded, and numbers of
the citizens called to pay their respects to the leading
officers.</p>

<p>At Guanica the following proclamation was issued to
the people of the island under the signature of General
Miles:</p>

<p class="guanica">"Guanica, Porto Rico, July 27, 1898.<br />
"To the Inhabitants of Porto Rico:</p>

<p>"In the prosecution of the war against the Kingdom
of Spain by the people of the United States, in the cause
of liberty, justice and humanity, its military forces have
come to occupy the islands of Porto Rico. They come
bearing the banners of freedom, inspired by noble purposes,
to seek the enemies of our government and of
yours, and to destroy or capture all in armed resistance.</p>

<p>"They bring you the fostering arms of a free people,
whose greatest power is justice and humanity to all living
within their fold. Hence they release you from
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>your former political relations, and it is hoped this will
be followed by the cheerful acceptance of the government
of the United States.</p>

<p>"The chief object of the American military forces
will be to overthrow the armed authority of Spain and
give the people of your beautiful island the largest
measure of liberty consistent with this military occupation.</p>

<p>"They have not come to make war on the people of
the country, who for centuries have been oppressed; but,
on the contrary, they bring protection, not only to yourselves,
but to your property, promote your prosperity
and bestow the immunities and blessings of our enlightenment
and liberal institutions and government. It is
not their purpose to interfere with the existing laws
and customs, which are wholesome and beneficial to
the people, so long as they conform to the rules of the
military administration, order and justice. This is not
a war of devastation and dissolution, but one to give all
within the control of the military and naval forces the
advantages and blessings of enlightened civilization."</p>

<p>The mayor of Guanica also issued a proclamation,
which was thus worded:</p>

<p>"Citizens: God, who rules the destinies of nations,
has decreed that the Eagle of the North, coming from
the waters of a land where liberty first sprang forth to
life, should extend to us his protecting wings. Under
his plumage, sweetly reposing, the Pearl of the Antilles,
called Porto Rico, will remain from July 25.</p>

<p>"The starry banner has floated gayly in the valleys of
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>Guanica, the most beautiful port of this downtrodden
land. This city was selected by General Miles as the
place in which to officially plant his flag in the name of
his government, the United States of America. It is the
ensign of grandeur and the guarantee of order, morality
and justice. Let us join together to strengthen, to support
and to further a great work. Let us clasp to our
bosoms the great treasure which is generously offered to
us while saluting with all our hearts the name of the
great Washington.</p>

<p class="guanica">"Augustin&nbsp;Barrenecha,&nbsp;Alcalde.<br />
"Guanica, Porto Rico, U. S. A., July 26, 1898."</p>

<p class="top5">Yauco was the next to surrender.</p>

<p>When the troops took possession of the town the
mayor promptly issued this proclamation:</p>

<p class="top5 nind">"Citizens:</p>

<p>"To-day the citizens of Porto Rico assist in one of
her most beautiful festivals. The sun of America shines
upon our mountains and valleys this day of July, 1898.
It is a day of glorious remembrance for each son of this
beloved isle, because for the first time there waves over
it the flag of the Stars, planted in the name of the Government
of the United States of America by the major-general
of the American Army, General Miles.</p>

<p>"Porto Ricans, we are by the miraculous intervention
of the God of the just given back to the bosom of our
mother America, in whose waters Nature placed us as
people of America. To her we are given back in the
name of her government by General Miles, and we must
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>send her our most expressive salutation of generous
affection through our conduct toward the valiant troops
represented by distinguished officers and commanded by
the illustrious General Miles.</p>

<p>"Citizens: Long live the Government of the United
States of America! Hail to their valiant troops! Hail
Porto Rico, always American!</p>

<p>"Yauco, Porto Rico, United States of America.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 33%;">"El Alcalde, Francisco Megia."</span></p>

<p class="top5">The alcalde is the judge who administers justice, and
he also presides as mayor over the City Council.</p>

<p>The citizens of the town hugged the Americans, and
some fell upon their knees and embraced the legs of the
soldiers. It was a most remarkable spectacle.</p>

<p>On July 29, Ponce was formally given over to the
Americans, without the firing of a single shot. The
populace received the troops and saluted the flag with
enthusiasm. When General Miles entered the city he
was welcomed by the mayor, cheered to the echo by the
citizens and serenaded by a band of music.</p>

<p>The mayor of Ponce issued a proclamation of the same
tenor as that of the mayor of Yauco, although not quite
so enthusiastic.</p>

<p>General Wilson was made military governor of Ponce.</p>

<p>A day or two after the taking of Ponce several local
judges were sworn into office. This was the first time in
the history of the United States that the judges of a
foreign, hostile but conquered country, swore to support
the Constitution of the United States.<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></p>

<p>The following was the form sworn to by the various
officials:</p>

<p>"I declare under oath that, during the occupation of
the island of Porto Rico by the United States, I will renounce
and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to every
foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, particularly
the Queen Regent and the King of Spain, and will
support the constitution of the United States against all
enemies, foreign or domestic, and will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.</p>

<p>"Further, I will faithfully support the Government of
the United States, established by the military authorities
in the island of Porto Rico, will yield obedience to the
same and take the obligation freely, without mental
reservation or with the purpose of evasion, so help me
God."</p>

<p>On July 31, the commanding general sent a message
to the War Department, the first official one received
from Ponce. It read as follows:</p>

<p class="top5">"Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:</p>

<p>"Your telegrams 27th received and answered by letter.
Volunteers are surrendering themselves with arms
and ammunition; four-fifths of the people are overjoyed
at the arrival of the army. Two thousand from one place
have volunteered to serve with it. They are bringing in
transportation, beef, cattle and other needed supplies.</p>

<p>"The Custom House has already yielded $14,000.</p>

<p>"As soon as all the troops are disembarked they will
be in readiness to move.<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></p>

<p>"Please send any national colors that can be spared,
to be given to the different municipalities.</p>

<p>"I request that the question of the tariff rates to be
charged in the parts of Porto Rico occupied by our
forces be submitted to the President for his action, the
previously existing tariff remaining meanwhile in force.
As to the government under military occupation, I have
already given instructions based upon the instructions
issued by the President in the case of the Philippine
Islands, and similar to those issued at Santiago de Cuba.</p>

<p class="r">"Miles."</p>

<p class="top5">When the soldiers entered Ponce the people sang the
"Star-Spangled Banner" in a mixture of Spanish and
English, and every time this tune was heard the police
forced everybody to remove his hat!</p>

<p>"The natives are, upon the whole, exceedingly
friendly," says a correspondent of the New York Sun,
"and almost all of them welcome the American army.
The flag is voluntarily displayed from many of the
principal stores. If there are any Spanish flags in the
city they are kept carefully concealed. In the stores
American goods are sometimes to be found, particularly
in hardware stores. All fabrics, foods, and luxuries,
however, have been imported from Europe, mostly from
Spain. The Spanish Government forces its colonies to
import from home by levying a heavy discriminating
duty upon all goods not Spanish. Prices are very high,
notwithstanding which fact business is brisk.</p>

<p>"The soldiers are good customers and buy all sorts of<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>
curios as souvenirs for friends at home. The officers,
too, buy considerable quantities of light underclothing.
It is safe to say that there has never before been as
much money in circulation here. All the merchants
favor annexation."</p>

<p>In an article in the National Magazine the following
is said:</p>

<p>"The Porto Ricans have taken very quickly and kindly
to American occupation. Some have been so quick in
changing that their conversion may be doubted. For
instance, the editor of La Nueva Era, a daily which in
two scraggy leaves purports to be a 'journal of news,
travel, science, literature and freedom,' was only a few
weeks ago raving at the 'American Pigs'; while now
he luxuriates under the eagle's ægis and writes eulogies
upon Benjamin Franklin, George Washington and William
McKinley. Nor is he alone in his devotion to the
American idea. The small boy curses his neighbor by
calling him 'un Espanol,' and treats you with disdain if
you suggest that he is simply a poor Porto Rican. 'No,
no,' he says, pointing at himself. 'No, Espanol, Porto-Rican
Americano.' His motives are not, however, always
of the sincerest, for the boys have learned a trick of saying
to the passing Yankee; 'Viva America,' and then
putting up the forefinger with this half-asked question,
'one cent?'"</p>

<p>A brilliant writer in one of the magazines says that in
speaking with a leading merchant of Ponce, he asked
him if the people were really so delighted with the new
regime.<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></p>

<p>"'Well, frankly, no,' he replied, 'the mass will welcome
any change, but it is quite a question whether we
shall gain by annexation to the United States. I
have lived in America. Now the Spaniards taxed us
heavily, but when they got their money they went off
and let us alone. The custom-house officers stole nearly
everything from the government. But then we have yet
to see how the American custom-house officers will act.
Spain knew us and we knew Spain; there were few
complaints. The church tax was not heavy, and I never
went to service. We do not want the negroes enfranchised
till they are better educated. Then the money
question is going to be bad for many of us here. We
shall suffer dreadfully if the American government
makes our dollar worth only fifty cents.'</p>

<p>"The man who uttered these words is a highly
respected citizen, speaks English well, and understands
America as well as Spain.</p>

<p>"While we were looking over the town we came upon
the jail where there are about one hundred and sixty
Spanish prisoners," the same writer goes on to say.
"Many of these men were selling their chevrons and
buttons and other marks of rank with an alacrity worthy
of a better cause. One of our party, however, experienced
a chill when upon asking one of the prisoners
how much he would sell his chevrons for he got this
reply, 'No, por el dinero en globo.' 'Not for all the
money on earth."</p>

<p>"There spoke the true spirit of Spain. The Spain
which sent armies to Jerusalem, patronized Columbus,<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>
conquered the half of America with a handful of men&mdash;that
Spain, with all her black tragedies, never sold her
chevrons. Let us be merciful to a fallen foe; at least, let
us be truthful. Thank God Spain's power in this hemisphere
is crushed. Yet there was chivalry in the old
regime. We can afford to be magnanimous now; he who
bends above the fallen forever stands erect."</p>

<p>On August 4, when rumors of Spain's submission
reached Porto Rico, the editor of La Nueva Era wound
up his leading editorial with these words:</p>

<p>"Hurra por la anexion a los Estados Unidos!"</p>

<p>He also gave this excellent sanitary advice to the invading
army:</p>

<p class="head">"TO THE BOYS!</p>

<p>"Keep away from fruit of every description and Rum,
if you wish to keep your health in this climate."</p>

<p>Moreover, he published this:</p>

<p>"It is an undeniable fact that wherever the American
forces have landed they have been welcomed by the people
as liberators amid the greatest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"A new era has dawned for this country and is the
advent of happier times.</p>

<p>"The spectre of suspicion with which we were menaced
has disappeared forever. We are now sure that the
air we breathe is ours and we can breathe it to our fill.</p>

<p>"The labor accomplished by the people of the United
States in taking this island, and we say accomplished,
as nothing can oppose their arms, is truly a labor of
humanity and redemption, and will be one of the greatest
glories of the great republic.<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></p>

<p>"Let us render thanks to the Almighty for the blessing,
and let us be well assured that Porto Rico has before
it a future of unlimited progress and well-being."</p>

<p>The most rabid Spanish publication of all, La Democracia,
issued an address to the public announcing the
demise of the paper under its former name, and giving
notice that it would reappear under the name of the
Courier with a portion printed in English.</p>

<p>In making this announcement the editor promised in
the new edition:</p>

<p>"To explain our ideas of brothership and harmony,
answering to the ideas proclaimed to the press by our
new military authority, such as that the American army
has not come as our enemies, but with the purpose of
harmonizing with the citizens of Porto Rico. We are
pleased to make known that these ideas have been respected,
and that all the acts of the forces occupying
our city have been characterized by the most exquisite
correctness, and that the American troops fraternize with
our people."</p>

<p>At all events, these extracts serve to show the trend
of public opinion.</p>

<p>"Mr. Morrisey in speaking of the Ponce of to-day says
that 'the city is in a horrible sanitary condition, and
I wondered how the United States troops stood it. I
learned there had been an improvement since the soldiers'
arrival, but there is room for considerable more, I
think. I went to the Hotel Ingleterra, which is considered
the best one in Ponce, and engaged a room. My
first meal there was breakfast, which was served at 11<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>
o'clock. My meal consisted of rice, black beans and
coffee, all of which was fair. At dinner, which is always
served at 6 o'clock, I had the same fare. I tried to get
eggs after the first day, but was successful on only two
occasions, and then had to pay 7 cents each for them. I
learned that the soldiers had made a corner in eggs and
had bought nearly all of them, which, of course, made
them scarce at the hotels and eating places. All the
water used in the hotel is filtered through a huge block
of brownstone and even then it is pretty poor.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Morrisey visited the place known as the market
in the heart of the city of Ponce, and saw some very
interesting scenes. A few of the better class of the
natives visited the market several times during the day
and made their purchases. There are no butchers in the
city, and it is a queer sight, Mr. Morrisey said, to see
the way the merchants deliver meat to the purchasers.
This article is bought by the penny and a piece about
as long as one's finger is sold for 2 cents. The meat is
not cut into steaks but in huge lumps. Another thing
in reference to the meat is that it is all killed the day
before used, which, of course, makes it very tough. The
beer on the island is kept in a warm place without any
ice and is served in that state. Most of the beer is imported
from Germany, and it is only recently that
American beer has found its way in the country. This
is kept in bottles and when it is served to a customer a
small piece of ice is dropped into it. The beer drinker
may imagine the rest. The natives do not use much of
the beer, but are satisfied with the black coffee and wine.<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></p>

<p>"The money question has not assumed any large proportions
in Porto Rico. Very little money is in circulation
on the island. The better class of the natives who
are supposed to have some money, spend most of their
time and money in Spain, and the stores and merchants,
as a result, do not get much of their money. These
stores are plentifully supplied with goods, but there is
no one to buy them. As soon as the United States soldiers
arrived on the island the shopkeepers saw visions
of money rolling into their pockets. The price on every
article in the stores was increased, and what a native
would buy for ten cents the American would be compelled
to pay one dollar for the same article. The fare
on the railroad running from Ponce to Playo, a distance
of about three miles, is one dollar for an excursion trip.
The natives make the same trip for twelve cents. Every
scheme that can be thought of is practiced by the natives
in order to get money from the Americans. In the street
and at the entrances to the hotels numerous beggars can
be found, all asking for money. Nearly all the inhabitants
seemed to be engaged in this sort of work, and the
sight of them lounging around, even inside the hotels,
is disgusting, says Mr. Morrisey. It is a hard matter to
get them to work, and their appearance in scarcely any
clothes on the streets is a sight.</p>

<p>"The women go about the roads and plantations smoking
large cigars, and are not affected in any manner by
the weed. Children of both sexes up to the age of twelve
years are permitted to roam about the streets naked,
while their parents are not much better off. Nothing<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>
but a skirt is worn by the women and the men wear
ragged shirts and trousers. Shoes are rarely seen in
Porto Rico and a native who is lucky enough to have
them is the cynosure of all eyes. The women do not
know what silks and satins are, and, it seems, are not
desirous of knowing. When night comes the men prepare
themselves for bed. This is not hard work, and
takes very little time. They tie their heads up in large
towels to protect them from the sting of the mosquito,
and then lie down in the streets or roads and sleep.
These people live mainly on the milk from the cocoanut.
Bread is a stranger to them, and very little food is consumed
by them, except the wild fruits and vegetables
which abound in the outskirts of the cities.</p>

<p>"Mr. Morrisey said the soldiers at Ponce were in a
fairly good condition, but it is his opinion that it is no
fit place for them under the present condition of the
country. He said when the soldier is taken down with
typhoid malaria or dysentery he loses flesh rapidly, and
he can never regain it as long as he stays in that
climate."</p>

<p>All this, although it is in some respects different from
some of the opinions we have quoted, is very interesting
as it is from a recent eye witness, and shows how Porto
Rico of the present impressed a very intelligent man.</p>

<p>The fourth town to surrender, previous to the news of
the armistice and therefore the general capitulation of
the island, was Juan Diaz. There was a report that
there were some Spanish soldiers there, and four companies
of the Sixteenth Pennsylvania were sent to find<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>
them. Couriers announced the coming of the Americans
to the people of the town, and a brass band came out to
meet them. The vast majority of the citizens assembled
on the outskirts of the town and as the American volunteers
appeared the band played "Yankee Doodle" and
other patriotic American airs, while the people cried:
"Vivan los Americanos."</p>

<p>A large number had presents of cigars, cigarettes, tobacco
and various fruits which they loaded upon the soldiers,
and many insisted upon taking the visitors to
their homes. Everywhere, the American flag was waving.
In the public square the mayor made a speech, in
which he said that all the people of Juan Diaz were
Americans now, and the crowd shouted:</p>

<p>"Death to the Spaniards!"</p>

<p>While speaking of Juan Diaz, perhaps it will prove of
interest to insert the opinion of a correspondent of one
of the New York papers as to the women of that town
and of Porto Rico in general. He says:</p>

<p>"No one ever walks in Porto Rico. The mule's the
thing here. The women ride a great deal. The better
class use the English side saddle, although a few prefer
the more picturesque and safer, but less graceful, Spanish
saddle. In the country districts the pillion is occasionally
employed, while among the lower classes many
women ride astride without exciting comment. When
the natives are both pretty and good riders they display
considerable coquetry in the saddle.</p>

<p>"I noticed one rider near Juan Diaz who took my mind
back to the old days of chivalry. She was a lovely girl<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>
of about fifteen or sixteen, with a face like a Madonna
and a figure like an artist's model. One little foot crept
out beneath her silk riding skirt, and to my surprise it
was devoid of hosiery. The skin was like polished velvet,
and was of a pinkish gold of an exquisite tint. It
was shod with a slipper of satin or silk, embroidered in
color and had an arched instep which made the foot all
the more charming by its setting.</p>

<p>"The time to see the women at their best is on Sunday
morning, when they ride from their homes to mass in
the nearest church or cathedral. On one Sunday morning,
while riding leisurely into a small village on my
way to this town, I met a crowd of worshippers on their
way to mass. Nearly all the women were on mule back,
and sat or lolled as if they were in an easy chair in their
own homes. A few, probably wealthier than the others,
or else delicate in health, were accompanied by little
darky boys, who held over them a parasol or an umbrella.</p>

<p>"On Sunday each woman wears a huge rosary, sometimes
so large as to be uncomfortable. I saw several that
were so unwieldy that they went over the shoulders and
formed a huge line, larger indeed than a string of sleigh
bells. These are ornamental rosaries and are not used
for prayer. The praying rosary is as small and dainty as
those used by fashionable women in our own Roman
Catholic churches. Besides the fan and the rosary every
woman was provided with a neat and often handsomely-bound
prayer book and a huge lighted cigar or
cigarette.<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></p>

<p>"This is indeed the land for women who love the weed.
A few smoke cigarettes and pipes, but the majority like
partajas, perfectos, Napoleons and other rolls of the
weed larger than those usually seen in our own land.
They smoke them at home and in the streets, at the
table or on the balcony, lying in hammocks, or lolling
on their steeds, and only desist when within the sacred
walls of the church. The moment mass is over and they
emerge into the sunlight the first thing the women do is
to light a fresh cigar and then climb into the saddle.</p>

<p>"They make a beautiful picture upon the roads. Imagine
an intensely blue sky above, with below rich green
vegetables and startling dashes of scarlet, crimson, vermillion,
orange and white from the flowers which seem
to bloom the year through, setting off the bright hues
of the costumes. It combines the picturesque side of
New Orleans life, of Florida scenery, of the Maine lake
country, and of the New Hampshire hills."</p>

<p>At Guayama there was even a greater reception than
at Juan Diaz. In fact, everywhere, as soon as the people
heard of the landing of our soldiers, the American flag
was hoisted and kept hoisted, while the Spaniards were
driven from the towns where soldiers were stationed.</p>

<p>A large number of Porto-Rican refugees now began to
return to the island. These were men who had been engaged
in revolution, and had been deported by the Spanish
Government. Their progress to their homes was a
continual ovation.</p>

<p>The returned refugees had a conference with the leading
citizens and there was no doubt in any one's mind<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>
but that ninety per cent. of the people was in favor of
annexation. They felt that the United States was their
deliverer, and they would rather join the American Republic
than have self-government.</p>

<p>There was also a conference between the most prominent
citizens of Ponce, and Mr. Hanna, the American
consul at San Juan.</p>

<p>The Porto Ricans had views which they wished to
have presented to the United States, and were anxious
to play some part in the new order of things and to hold
some of the offices themselves. They were particularly
desirous to know about the American school system and
as to the possibility of introducing it into the island.
They wished that their children should learn to speak
English. Mr. Hanna explained the public school system
of the United States, and the Porto Ricans were greatly
pleased at what they heard. Then they again brought
up the question of how they could participate in the reorganization
of the island.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Mr. Hanna, "the best thing you
can do is to get together and find out just what you
want. You have, of course, very good ideas as to what
the American system of government is. You no doubt
by this time know whether you desire to be attached to
the United States as a territory, with a representative
in our Congress. You may differ on the point of having
Americans for your own officials here during the time
that the government that is to prevail here is being put
into shape. But you can safely leave your wishes in the
hands of President McKinley."<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></p>

<p>A New York Herald correspondent has some interesting
things to say as to the new Ponce, a town which is
representative of the entire island:</p>

<p>"Ponce, only yesterday the base for our military invasion,
is to-day the American capital in the West
Indies. Ponce is deep in the second stage of political
evolution.</p>

<p>"Ponce is learning the English language. Ponce is
mastering the mysteries of American money. Ponce is
inquiring into the methods of American politics. Ponce
is preparing to abandon the church schools and adopt
our system of education. Papeti, the chambermaid in
the Hotel Francais, has already been taught to say,
"Vive l'Americano!" Papeti's brother was shot by the
Spanish a few years ago.</p>

<p>"El Capitan," the head waiter at the Hotel Inglaterra,
has already mastered one hundred words of English,
and his fortune is made. Passing down the street
just now I heard a Porto Rican mother crooning her
naked babe to sleep to the tune of 'Marching Through
Georgia.' The Porto Ricans think that 'Marching
Through Georgia' is a national anthem.</p>

<p>"As I write the advance guard of the American prospector
to this tropical Klondike of ours are pouring up
the broad highway from the playa to the town. They
came on the Sylvia, the first merchant ship to reach
Ponce from the United States since the town surrendered.
They seem to have come literally by hundreds.</p>

<p>"I saw many familiar faces among the newcomers.</p>

<p>"Nearly all these men have come here on commercial<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
enterprises. Porto Rico is a fruitful field. Her agricultural
resources, taking the American standard, are as
little developed as those of Ohio seventy-five years ago.
I imagine the coffee production of the island will be
doubled in two years.</p>

<p>"Much American capital will be put into sugar,
tobacco and fruits. Many of these men are inquiring
about estates in the interior that can be purchased or
leased, and about facilities for transportation to the sea-board.
This means the building of railroads. Banks are
also to be opened in Ponce under our national banking
law, and I fancy there will be the liveliest sort of race
between rival capitalists as to who shall get the electric
railway franchise for the city of Ponce.</p>

<p>"The leading citizens of the island are as wideawake
to American enterprise as are these eager gentlemen of
the pocketbook who came on the Sylvia."</p>

<p>Colonel Hill of General Wilson's staff was appointed
Collector of the Port of Ponce, and he went very carefully
into the subject of the probable resources of the
island and what the new tariff should be.</p>

<p>In an interview with the Herald, he said:</p>

<p>"Most of my statistics are still incomplete, but I can
give you a few facts, which will unquestionably be of
great interest to the business men of the States. In
Porto Rico everything is taxed, and most articles are
taxed in several different ways. There is an impost duty
on flour of $4 a barrel. I think that will be knocked off
at once. As you know, this island paid no direct money
to the former government of Spain. Everything in the<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>
way of salaries, pensions, etc., is paid directly out of
the Custom House. The commander of the military
forces on the island is a lieutenant-general, sent here
from Spain. He gets an enormous salary. Many Spanish
pensioners of prominence and rank have been sent to
the island, and these pensions are paid by the island.
Dignitaries of the church and priests are sent here in
large numbers. They are paid out of the Custom House.</p>

<p>"Only yesterday I had an application from the widow
of a Spanish general, who is pensioned, for the payment
of her usual stipend. I had to take that matter under
advisement. The priests here in Ponce applied for their
usual salary for July. This, under the Spanish law, is a
fixed charge. The matter came before me in my capacity
of judge-advocate on General Wilson's staff. I had to
report that inasmuch as we were operating under the
Spanish civil law, which made the salaries of the padres
a proper payment from the customs funds, the money
was due and should be paid or else the Spanish civil
law in that respect should be annulled or suspended.</p>

<p>"General Wilson refused to authorize the payment of
the priests' salaries, and the matter went to General
Miles, who sustained General Wilson. Now here is a
very interesting and unprecedented question. As a matter
of policy it might be well to pay these salaries for
the present. The padres, of course, the next time they
address the congregation will say: 'Here is this new
American Government which you welcomed with such
pleasure refusing to pay your priests. You thought you
were going to be relieved of taxation. We must ask you<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>
to go into your pockets and pay us yourselves. Thus
you have an additional tax placed upon you.'"</p>

<p>But still the clergy, as a rule, were in favor of the
United States.</p>

<p>Father Janices, a well-known and most intelligent
priest, had this to say in regard to the attitude of the
Catholic Church in Porto Rico toward the United
States:</p>

<p class="top5">"We are neither cowards nor liars. We do not deny
that we have always been loyal Spanish subjects, but it
is the duty of the Church to save souls and not to mingle
in international quarrels.</p>

<p>"With all our hearts we welcome the Americans.
Your constitution protects all religions. We ask only
for the protection of our Church. The Archbishop of
Porto Rico is now in Spain, and the Vicar General of
San Juan is acting head of the Church in the island.
But we no longer look to him as our ecclesiastical head;
but as soon as possible we shall communicate with Cardinal
Gibbons and we await his wishes.</p>

<p>"Should any American soldier desire the administrations
of a priest, they always shall be at his service. We
have determined to become loyal Americans."</p>

<p>Moreover, on September 23, Captain Gardner, in
company of General Wilson, called upon the President
and made a report in which he elaborated upon the relation
of the Church to the government. He stated that
while a large majority of the Porto Ricans were Catholics,
by profession, they were not offensively zealous.
He placed the number of priests at 240, and the annual<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>
cost to the public treasury of their support at about
$120,000 in American money.</p>

<p>Colonel Gardner, in addition to his report, also presented
to President McKinley, an address signed by
many of the leading Porto Ricans. The signers expressed
their pleasure at the prospect of becoming citizens
of the United States, and announced their hope
that the Porto Rican people might some day become
worthy to organize a State of the Union.</p>

<p>In this hope we are sure all Americans will most
heartily join.<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="head">OUR CLAIM TO PORTO RICO.</p>


<p>One great question raised by the recent war was that
of territorial expansion, and this question called forth
many expressions of opinion both for and against.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, but that Porto Rico is
ours by the right of conquest, and that it would be a
crime from every point of view for us not to retain it.</p>

<p>That we shall retain it, too, now seems certain.</p>

<p>Let us now, in the first place, look back and see what
two of our most prominent statesmen have said in the
past. They may be looked upon almost as prophets.</p>

<p>The idea of territorial expansion is not a new one. In
fact, it dates back half a century, and the thought of
this expansion has been silently hatched ever since.</p>

<p>In 1846, William H. Seward, afterward Secretary of
State under the administration of Abraham Lincoln,
published an open letter under the title, "We Should
Carry Out Our Destiny."</p>

<p>To carry out that destiny, said Mr. Seward in this
letter, the United States should prepare themselves for
their mission by getting rid of the Old World which
still continued with ideas of another age upon portions
of the American soil.</p>

<p>In the same letter Mr. Seward also said that the monarchies
of Europe could have neither peace nor truce as<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>
long as there remained to them one colony upon this
continent.</p>

<p>This Mr. Seward called buying out the foreigners. In
1846 he counted the ruler of Cuba and Porto Rico among
the foreigners which should sell out their possessions to
the United States.</p>

<p>It was he who during his term of office purchased
Alaska from the Czar of Russia for the sum of $7,200,000.
He also negotiated for the acquisition of the Danish
Antilles, but this project fell through, chiefly for the
reason that at that time the President was opposed to it.</p>

<p>In politics Mr. Seward favored a system which he
compared to the ripe pear that detaches itself and falls
into your hand.</p>

<p>One thing seemed to him certain, and that was that
the United States could not help annexing by force the
people who would be too slow to come to them of their
own free will.</p>

<p>"I abhor war," he wrote. "I would not give one
single human life for any portion of the continent which
remains to be annexed; but I cannot get rid of the conviction
that popular passion for territorial aggrandizement
is irresistible. Prudence, justice and even timidity
may restrain it for a time, but its force will be augmented
by compression."</p>

<p>It was a half century before the explosion occurred,
but when it came its echoes resounded all over the world,
carrying joy to some and fear to others, fear of this
young giant of the New World.</p>

<p>Again in 1852, in a speech made before the Senate<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>
upon the question of American commerce in the Pacific,
Mr. Seward thus addressed his colleagues:</p>

<p>"The discovery of this continent and of those islands
and the organization upon their soil of societies and
governments have been great and important events.
After all, they are merely preliminaries, a preparation
by secondary incidents, in comparison with the sublime
result which is about to be consummated&mdash;the junction
of the two civilizations upon the coast and in the
islands of the Pacific. There certainly never happened
upon this earth any purely human event which is comparable
to that in grandeur and in importance. It will
be followed by the levelling of social conditions and by
the re-establishment of the unity of the human family.
We now see clearly why it did not come about sooner
and why it is coming now."</p>

<p>At a reception given to his honor in Paris, just after
the close of the Franco-Prussian war, Mr. Seward found
himself the centre of a group, mostly composed of young
Americans.</p>

<p>He had just almost completed a tour around the
world, and in answer to a question as to what had impressed
him most during his travels, he answered practically
as follows:</p>

<p>"Boys, the fact is the Americans are the only nation
that has and understands liberty. With us a man is a
man, absolutely free and politically equal with all, with
special privileges for none. Every one has a chance,
whereas, wherever I have been I was impressed with
the subjugation and oppression of the people. I had all<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>
my life talked in public and private of the greatness of
our mission of civilization and progress, of the ideas we
represented, and the lessons we were teaching the world,
but I never realized how true it was that we were of all
others the representatives of human progress. Now I
know it. I am sure now, from what I have myself seen,
that nothing I have ever said or others have said, as to
the destiny of our country was exaggerated. I am an
old man now and may not see it, but some of you boys
may live to see American ideas and principles and civilization
spread around the world, and lift up and regenerate
mankind."</p>

<p>The opinion of another old-time statesman, given
some quarter of a century ago, is of vivid interest to-day.</p>

<p>In 1872, when the Geneva Convention was holding its
deliberations, Mr. William M. Evarts spoke words of
wisdom to a company of distinguished guests at a
luncheon given by him at the house in which he was
then living.</p>

<p>Among others present were Charles Francis Adams,
Caleb Cushing, Morrison R. Waite, afterward Chief
Justice; J. Bancroft Davis, Charles C. Beaman, and
others of the American Commission.</p>

<p>What Mr. Evarts said was in substance as follows:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, God has America in his direct keeping,
and lets it work out its destinies in accordance with
His own wishes and for His own purpose. When the
time came and Europe needed an outlet for its surplus
energy, God let down the bars and America was discovered.
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>Then little colonies of enterprising and progressive
men, seeking freedom from troubles and oppressions of
their native land, founded homes along the Atlantic coast.
He had let down the bars again for his own purposes.
These men struggled and fought and progressed in
civilization and liberty until the time came when
again the bars were let down and we had the Revolution,
and the colonies became a nation. Again the bars
went down, and then came the Mexican war, giving the
nation the room necessary for its expansion, the space
necessary for the homes of the millions from the Old
World who sought the freedom of the New. From
Atlantic to Pacific that little fringe of people of the
colonial times had evolved until they were a great
nation. We needed the precious metals, and gold and
silver were found sufficient for our purposes. God had
let down the bars. But one thing remained, one canker
and sore, one great evil which threatened and worried
and troubled, but God in His own good time again let
down the bars and it was forever swept away, for He
allowed the rebellion. He gave humanity and justice
and right the victory. He restored the Union, He will
heal the sores, He will lead the people to its final destiny
as the advance guard of civilization, progress and
the upbuilding and elevation of mankind, and in good
time the bars will be again let down for the benefit of
humanity&mdash;when or why we know not, but He knows."</p>

<p>In the light of recent events, the utterances of these
two great men are certainly deserving of the utmost consideration.
Both of them really seem to be seers, who,<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>
from their observations of the past, saw visions of the
future for the native land they loved so well.</p>

<p>The Paris Figaro, in a remarkable article, says that,
willingly or forcibly, America must belong to the Americans.
The New World must gird up its loins and be
ready to fulfill its mission. And this must be done by
force when persuasion is not sufficient. And when the
Americans shall have rejoined Europe in some portion
of Asia, concludes the Figaro, and closed the ring of
white civilization around the globe, will they stop or
can they stop? That is the secret of the future. Its solution
will depend upon what they will find before them&mdash;a
Europe torn and divided, or, as it has been said, the
United States of Europe. At all events, they will have
the right to be proud, because they will have carried out
their destiny.</p>

<p>Now to turn to an opinion by an Englishman, and be
it remembered that England stood by us in a remarkable
way from the very beginning of the Spanish-American
war and undoubtedly prevented the other European
nations from interfering.</p>

<p>The opinion we are about to give is from the pen of
Mr. Henry Norman, the special commissioner of the
London Chronicle.</p>

<p>Among other things, Mr. Norman says in an article
entitled "A War-Made New America":</p>

<p>"The vision of a new Heaven and a new earth is still
unfulfilled, but there is a new America. The second
American Revolution has occurred, and its consequences
may be as great as those of the first. The American<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>
people are as sensitive to emotional or intellectual stimulus
as a photographic film is to light, but they are also
to a remarkable degree, a people of second thoughts.
Their nerves are quick, but their convictions are slow.
The apparent change was so great and so unexpected
that at first I could not bring myself to believe in its
reality or its endurance. Unless all signs fail, however,
or I fail to interpret them, the old America, the America
obedient to the traditions of the founders of the republic,
is passing away, and a new America, an America standing
armed, alert and exigent in the arena of the world-struggle,
is taking its place.</p>

<p>"The change is three-fold:</p>

<p>"I. The United States is about to take its place
among the great armed powers of the world.</p>

<p>"II. By the seizure and retention of territory not only
not contiguous to the borders of the republic, but remote
from them, the United States becomes a colonizing
nation, and enters the field of international rivalries.</p>

<p>"III. The growth of good will and mutual understanding
between Great Britain and the United States
and the settlement of all pending disputes between
Canada and America, now virtually assured, constitute
a working union of the English-speaking people against
the rest of the world for common ends, whether any
formal agreement is reached or not."</p>

<p>Mr. Norman goes on to say, after speaking of the
possible American army and navy of the present and the
future:</p>

<p>"And look at the display of American patriotism.<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>
When the volunteers were summoned by the President
they walked on the scene as if they had been waiting in
the wings. They were subjected to a physical examination
as searching as that of a life insurance company. A
man was rejected for two or three filled teeth. They
came from all ranks of life. Young lawyers, doctors,
bankers, well-paid clerks are marching by thousands in
the ranks. The first surgeon to be killed at Guantanamo
left a New York practice of $10,000 a year to volunteer.
As I was standing on the steps of the Arlington Hotel
one evening a tall, thin man, carrying a large suitcase,
walked out and got on the street car for the railway
station on his way to Tampa. It was John Jacob Astor,
the possessor of a hundred millions of dollars. Theodore
Roosevelt's rough riders contain a number of the smartest
young men in New York society. A Harvard class-mate
of mine, a rising young lawyer, is working like a
laborer at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, not knowing when
he may be ordered to Cuba or Manila. He is a naval
reserve man and sent in his application for any post
'from the stoke hole upward.' The same is true of women.
When I called to say good-by to Mrs. John Addison
Porter, the wife of the Secretary to the President,
whose charming hospitality I had enjoyed, she had gone
to Tampa to ship as a nurse on the Red Cross steamer
for the coast of Cuba. And all this, be it remembered,
is for a war in which the country is not in the remotest
danger, and when the ultimate summons of patriotism
is unspoken. Finally, consider the reference to the war
loan. A New York syndicate offered to take half of it at<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>
a premium which would have given the Government a
clear profit of $1,000,000. But the loan was wisely offered
to the people and the small investor gets all he can buy
before the capitalist is even permitted to invest. And
from Canada to the Gulf, from Long Island to Seattle,
the money of the people is pouring in."</p>

<p>Mr. Norman concludes his article with these pregnant
words, words which will force every man of any brains
whatever to pause and think:</p>

<p>"Here, then, is the new America in one aspect&mdash;armed
for a wider influence and a harder fight than any
she has envisaged before. And what a fight she will
make! Dewey, with his dash upon Manila; Hobson and
his companions, going quietly to apparently certain
death, and ships offering the whole muster roll as volunteers
to accompany him; Rowan, with his life in his
hand at every minute of his journey to Gomez and back,
worse than death awaiting him if caught; Blue, making
his 70-mile reconnoissance about Santiago; Whitney,
with compass and notebook in pocket, dishwashing his
perilous way round to Porto Rico&mdash;this is the old daring
of our common race. If the old lion and the young
lion should ever go hunting side by side&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Mr. Norman wisely leaves his last sentence unfinished.
For no man can predict what the result would be.
Would it be the subjugation of the entire world to the
Anglo-Saxon race?</p>

<p>After considering what the French and the English
have to say, now let us turn to the utterances of the
Hon. Andrew H. Green, who spoke purely in the interests
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>of a private citizen, one who desired the retention
of the territory acquired by the American Government
solely because he wished that the people of the United
States should not underestimate the value of their grand
opportunities for national enrichment.</p>

<p>"War with Spain," said Mr. Green, in the beginning of
his interview in the Sun, "was declared by the authorized
authorities, whether wisely or otherwise, it is not
now of much profit to discuss. It has been prosecuted
with vigor and brought to a successful issue with a dispatch
unprecedented in conflicts of equal magnitude.
What shall be done with its results? What, in this age
of enlightenment and progress, shall we do with the territories
and with their peoples and property that the
fate of war has placed under our control and guardianship?"</p>

<p>Mr. Green concludes his interview as follows:</p>

<p>"As occasion offered heretofore the American people
have insisted upon acquiring and holding territory when
the interests of the country required it. Looking at all
the precedents, at the present situation, at the signs
and needs of the times, there is but little room to doubt
that the permanent retention of all territory acquired
from Spain will, in the interest of humanity and duty,
be demanded with equal firmness. We shall go on in the
same course of expansion which we have pursued from
our earliest history as an independent nation. We have
'hoisted the mainsail' of the ship of state and started
her about the world. While heeding Washington's
warnings and the popular interpretation of the Monroe<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>
doctrine to keep the people of other nations from getting
a foothold on this continent, we shall not pervert
their spirit by stubbornly refusing to improve an opportunity
to extend and increase our power and our commerce.
Every extension of our territory hitherto made
has been resisted by a spirit the same in essence as that
which now timidly opposes our improving the wonderful
opportunities put in our hands by the happy fortune
of war; but such opposition has failed of its purpose invariably
hitherto, and it will fail now with the American
people. The sacrifices of the war will not have been
in vain and the victories won by the valor of our navy
and army will not fail of their legitimate and well-earned
points."</p>

<p>We are a practical people. There can be no doubt
about that, but still we are occasionally moved by sentiment,
as when we undertook to free Cuba from oppression,
but at the bottom of every national action there is
a sound practical idea.</p>

<p>It was a pure and unselfish sentiment, however, that
impelled us to prevent the extermination of the people
of Cuba, a country so near to our own doors, and to demand
for them by force of arms, the freedom and independence
which was and is most unquestionably their
right.</p>

<p>With Cuba freed, the rule of Spaniards in Porto Rico
would be both absurd and dangerous. It would be a
menace to the perpetual peace between Spain and the
United States, which the latter are determined on for
the future.<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></p>

<p>Moreover, as we have seen, Porto Rico wishes most
strongly to become an integral portion of the Union, and
we desire to receive her as such.</p>

<p>The rule of common sense should be applied, and both
sentiment and practicality are united in calling for the
conditions which the American Government has demanded
as to the former Spanish possessions in the
Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The war against Spain was inevitable, was just and
necessary for the sake of humanity and the progress of
the world. Both our army and navy have shown glorious
bravery and heroism, and their marvelous achievements
must not be allowed to bring forth no results.</p>

<p>By the fortunes of war a great responsibility has
been placed in the hands of the United States, and it
would be criminal to shirk in any respect this responsibility.
We must not give back to Spain any portion of
the earth in which to continue her abominable misrule.
Let the United States move forward to its manifest
destiny.</p>

<p>In a powerful editorial the New York Sun declares
that our success will make for the world's peace. We
alone were the nation to free Cuba and the other Spanish
colonies. No one of the European powers could have
come forward to the rescue of the colonies without provoking
the enmity and jealousy of the other powers. If
we had neglected to discharge our duty, then that duty
would probably have fallen to a commission of the
European nations. The consequence would have been
that Spain would have been superseded in the Spanish<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>
Antilles by a strong European power, which would have
led sooner or later to a partition of Spanish America.
The United States alone could upset Spanish colonial
rule without exciting an uncontrollable outburst of envy
and greed in Europe, and occasion a general scramble
for the spoils of the New World.</p>

<p>Neither Cuba nor Porto Rico could have been kept by
Spain with any assurance of the general safety of
nations. So long as the so-called mother country exercised
any power there, both the islands would have been
firebrands, which, if not aflame, would surely have been
smouldering.</p>

<p>The Sun concludes its editorial with these words:</p>

<p>"It is, in a word, for the interest of the whole civilized
world that all of Spain's colonies, with the possible
exception of the Canaries, should be turned over to us.
It is for the world's interests because, in her hands,
they always have been, and always would be, a menace
to the general peace. If this be true, and that it is cannot
be gainsaid, the sooner the transfer is made the better.
The fire, which now is localized, should be put out
quickly, lest it spread. A thousand accidents, contingencies,
inadvertencies, may lead to the very complications
which all of the European powers, except Spain,
are anxious to avoid. We except Spain because, in putting
off the evil day and in postponing submission to
the terms which our duty to mankind compels us to impose,
she can have no other hope, no other purpose,
than to bring about such international entanglements as
may cause a general war. Spain alone has anything to<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>
gain from such a contest; in it she would at least have
allies, and would expect to see her thirst for revenge
upon us gratified. The great powers of Europe, however,
do not mean to risk an &oelig;cumenical convulsion for the
sake of a decadent monarchy, which, considered as the
trustee of colonies, has been tried in the balance and
found wanting. They recognize that, in seeking to
evade the sentence of rigorous isolation which the conscience
of mankind has passed upon her, she is jeopardizing
the peace of the world. For that reason they are
exerting and will continue to exert all the means of moral
pressure at their command to induce the Spaniards to
accept promptly such terms as our Government may
offer."</p>

<p>The people of the United States, after the armistice
was declared, were united in one thing, and that was,
that apart from the question of indemnity, the one condition
of peace, final and unvariable, would in the nature
of the case be this:</p>

<p>The surrender and cession to the United States, now
and forever, of all Spain's possessions in the western
waters of both Atlantic and Pacific.</p>

<p>The fortune of a war begun for the liberation of one
people has put it into the power of the United States to
liberate several peoples. All this territory, which
is ours by right, must henceforth be consecrated to
freedom.</p>

<p>Colonel Alexander McClure, in an address at the laying
of the cornerstone of the new State Capitol of Pennsylvania,
expressed most eloquently the true American<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>
feeling in regard to the possessions which our naval and
military prowess won from Spain:</p>

<p>"The same supreme power that demanded this war
will demand the complete fulfillment of its purpose. It
will demand, in tones which none can misunderstand
and which no power or party can be strong enough to
disregard, that the United States' flag shall never be
furled in any Spanish province where it has been
planted by the heroism of our army and navy.</p>

<p>"Call it imperialism if you will; but it is not the imperialism
that is inspired by the lust of conquest.
It is the higher and nobler imperialism that voices
the sovereign power of this nation and demands
the extension of our flag and authority over the
provinces of Spain, solely that 'government of the people
by the people, and for the people shall not perish
from the earth.'</p>

<p>"Such is the imperialism that has become interwoven
with the destiny of our great free Government, and it
will be welcomed by our people regardless of party lines,
and will command the commendation of the enlightened
powers of the Old World, as it rears, for the guidance
of all, the grandest monuments of freedom as the proclaimed
policy and purpose of the noblest Government
ever reared by a man or blessed by Heaven."<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="head">WHAT THE POSSESSION OF PORTO RICO WILL MEAN.</p>


<p>The heading of this chapter presents a most difficult
problem at this time. It would require an inspired
prophet to answer the question, and all that we can do
is to look at it as dispassionately as possible, and to
show the opinions of those who are more or less informed
upon the subject. From these opinions the
reader must of necessity draw his own conjectures.</p>

<p>Of course, from the very nature of conditions the land
is at the present time of writing in a most unsettled
state, from a political, commercial and social point of
view.</p>

<p>A new element has entered into the lives of the Porto
Ricans, and this new element naturally brings with it
an unknown future.</p>

<p>The Spaniards and Porto Ricans have but little idea
of political tolerance. They are enemies, now, and both
seem to think that the opposite party is to be abused,
persecuted and even tortured.</p>

<p>Many of the Porto Ricans, on the word of a competent
authority, believe that violence to the persons or
property of the Spaniards will be acceptable to the
Americans. The Spaniards, sharing this belief, live in a
constant state of terror, fearing for their possessions
and even for their lives.<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></p>

<p>The withdrawal to an extent of the Spanish troops
gave the guerillas full license, and they burned a number
of plantations before our forces were put in charge.</p>

<p>Both natives and Spanish, it might be said, were busy
in cutting each other's throats. The people became more
or less terrorized, and begged for American protection.</p>

<p>About the first of September, Major-General Wilson
met at dinner a large number of prominent islanders,
and in response to a toast, he made a rather long speech.
As this speech was and is of great interest, we make no
apology for reproducing almost in full here.</p>

<p>General Wilson said:</p>

<p>"The great Republic, unlike the governments of
Europe, has no subjects. It extends its rights and
privileges freely and equally to all men, regardless of
race or color or previous condition, who reside within
its far-reaching dominions. It makes citizens of all who
forswear their allegiance to foreign Powers, princes and
potentates, and promise henceforth to bear true faith
and allegiance to the United States.</p>

<p>"The expulsion of the Spanish power from your beautiful
and long-suffering island and the hoisting of the
American flag will be followed shortly, let us hope, by
the establishment of a stable civil administration, based
on the American principle of local self-government.</p>

<p>"The government now exercising supreme authority
in the island, you will understand, is a government of
conquest, in which the will of the military commander
is substituted for that of the Spanish king and Cortes.
It does not pretend to interfere with the local laws, <a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>except
in so far as may be necessary to protect the army
of the United States and maintain peace and good order
among the people of the island. It looks to the local
courts to do justice as between man and man, and to the
moderation and good sense of the people themselves for
the maintenance of public tranquility, and for the cultivation
of that perfect respect for the rights of persons
and property which constitutes the foundation of the
American system of government.</p>

<p>"It has been wisely said by one of the fathers of the
republic that 'That government is best which governs
least,' and this is the principle which Porto Rico should
keep constantly in view. Government interference is
necessary only when the people, instead of confining
themselves exclusively to their own particular affairs,
presume to interfere with the affairs of their neighbors.</p>

<p>"If every one, high and low, rich and poor, Porto Rican
and Spaniard, devotes himself strictly and exclusively
to his own private or official business, eschewing politics
and public affairs, for the next year, everybody will
find at the end of that time that the island has been well
governed and prosperous, and your American fellow
citizens will proclaim you worthy of the good fortune
which has united your destinies to those of the great
Republic.</p>

<p>"Permit me to add that as soon as the Spaniards have
evacuated the island, and the sovereignty of the United
States is fully established, a military governor will be
appointed by the President, and he will govern in the
main in accordance with the principles I have indicated.<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>
How long this military government will last must depend
largely upon the people of Porto Rico themselves.</p>

<p>"In the natural and regular course of events the military
government should be followed by a territorial government
established by act of Congress, and this in time
should be followed in a few years by a government
which shall make Porto Rico a sovereign State of the
great Republic, and give it all the rights guaranteed by
the constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>"Permit me to add, before concluding, that you are
likely to meet with delay in the realization of your
hopes from two principal causes.</p>

<p>"It is well known in the United States that Porto
Rico is a Roman Catholic country, and there is grave
objection on the part of many good people against the
admission of a purely Roman Catholic State into the
Union. This is based not so much on opposition to
that particular religion as on the feeling that the
domination of any sect would be prejudicial to our principles
of government. We have, perhaps, ten millions
of Roman Catholics in the United States, but they are
scattered throughout the various States, and intermingled
everywhere with the Protestant sects, so that
no one has a majority. We have no established Church,
and under our policy Congress can pass no act concerning
religion or limiting the right of any citizen to worship
God as he pleases.</p>

<p>"The result is that all the churches are absolutely
free, and none concerns itself with politics. Each<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>
watches to see that the other does not get control of the
State.</p>

<p>"Now that the Spanish government has been expelled,
it can no longer support the Church in this
island, hence the Church will necessarily have a hard
struggle till it can establish itself on the basis of voluntary
parochial support. Meanwhile the Protestant denominations
in the United States will have the right to
send their missionaries into this inviting field, where
they will doubtless receive a hearty welcome, but still
the advantage will remain with the Roman Catholic
Church, in which the people have been born, married
and buried for the last four hundred years.</p>

<p>"Besides, it must not be forgotten that the Church,
like every other institution of the island, will surely
realize its full share of the benefits arising from the
union of the island with the great Republic. It will,
therefore, become more liberal and independent, as well
as more powerful than it has ever been.</p>

<p>"Fortunately for you, however, every other Christian
denomination will from this time forth be free to make
converts, establish churches, open schools and circulate
religious books and newspapers, and generally to show
that it is a worthy teacher and guide to a higher and
better civilization than ever prevails where one Church
holds undisputed sway.</p>

<p>"The second great menace to the future of the Porto
Rican people is the danger of an outbreak of violence
and intolerance on the part of one section of your people
against another; the danger of insular turning against<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>
peninsular; of Porto Rican turning against Spaniard,
with the torch and dagger, to avenge himself for the
wrongs and oppressions, real or imaginary, which have
so long characterized the Spanish domination in this
beautiful island.</p>

<p>"It needs no argument to show that such an outbreak
if it becomes general, cannot fail to bring discredit on
your countrymen as a turbulent and law-breaking people
who cannot be intrusted with the precious privilege of
self-government, and must therefore be ruled by a military
commander.</p>

<p>"I firmly believe that the Porto Ricans are a docile,
orderly and kindly people, well prepared for a better
government than they have ever enjoyed, but you must
lose no opportunity to impress upon the United States
that you are tolerant and magnanimous as well.</p>

<p>"Your wrongs, whatever they were, have been
avenged by the expulsion of the Spanish flag and the
Spanish dominion, without exertion or cost on your
part, and the least you can do in return is to repress the
spirit of revenge and resolve to live in peace and
quietude with your Spanish neighbors, respecting their
rights of persons and property, as you desire to have
your own respected.</p>

<p>"In this way, and in this way only, can you show
yourselves to be worthy of the great destiny which has
overtaken you, and which, let us hope, is to speedily
clothe your island with sovereignty as a member of the
great continental Republic.</p>

<p>"Thus, and thus only, can we become fellow citizens<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>
indeed in perpetual enjoyment of our common and inestimable
heritage as citizens of the freest, richest and most
powerful nation in the world." The Hon. A. H. Green
speaks as follows of the present condition of Porto Rico:</p>

<p>"The problems that force themselves upon the attention
at the outset are those of government and of finance.
The first question that naturally arises is, what shall be
done with these possessions? How shall they, with
their unassimilated populations, be cared for? The presence
of a military force will doubtless be an immediate
necessity. It should be administered in the mildest
form, unless riot and disorder otherwise require, and be
controlled by officers humane and intelligent, inclined
to encourage at the earliest practical time the inauguration
of a civil rule which shall gradually and as rapidly
as may be found wise invite an official participation of
representatives of the indigenous populations. Can this
be done? Let the doubting and the timid recall what
has been done, and is now doing toward improving the
conditions of the peoples of the East and ask themselves
whether America is not likely to be equally successful
in caring for those whose destinies she has assumed to
direct; whether it is not her duty to enforce order and
to keep the peace among peoples who by her acts have
been left disorganized and defenseless, a prey to the internecine
strifes of barbarous chiefs and to the intrigues
of roaming banditti? And have not experiences in assimilating
Spanish territories hitherto successfully annexed
or conquered proved abundantly our ability to
do all this?<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></p>

<p>"It is natural enough that conservative minds should
adhere to the traditions of the past, but times are
changed, and the wisest of our forefathers were not able
to foresee what the workings of centuries might effect.
The atrocities to which the inhabitants of Cuba have
been subjected in the past two or more years aroused
the indignation of the civilized world.</p>

<p class="poem">"'Their moans, the vales redoubled to the hills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">And they to Heav'n.'</span></p>

<p>"The financial problem, which is already commanding
the serious attention of the Government, is next in
order. How are the great expenditures of the war to be
recouped? Shall we, in addition to territory acquired,
demand cash indemnity? If the care of these acquisitions
is to be as costly as some suppose, it would not be
an unreasonable requirement. While we shall lose the
revenues derived from imposts upon importations into
the United States from these possessions, which were
not large, this will be more than compensated by the
duties which we can impose upon importations from
other nations into them. In making up the estimates of
the whole financial situation it will be safe to assume
that at first our Government outlays will exceed income;
our people, however, will have the profit of furnishing
products of the United States to an added population
of 10,000,000 to 12,000,000, freed from the duty
that we can impose upon the imports of other nations.
Of the $10,000,000 in value of imports into the Philippines
from all countries, we supplied less than $200,000,
while we took from them nearly $5,000,000.<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></p>

<p>"The interests of the people who gain their living
and manual labor are among the first to be considered
and jealously guarded. Fortunately the far greater part
of these in America are engaged in employments which
will be benefited by annexation. A fresh and unrestrained
market is to be opened for our products, and the
indigenous products of these regions are to be brought
here free of duty to give added employment to our factories.
No competitions of labor are to arise."</p>

<p>As to our new acquisition of new colonies by the
United States, Theodore S. Wolsey, Professor of International
Law at Yale University, has this to say, and
every word he utters is pregnant with meaning, for no
one could be a more capable judge:</p>

<p>"It has already been said that England learned the
lesson of the American Revolution, while Spain has
never heeded it nor the loss of her own colonies. Yet
it really was not until fifty years ago that their methods
sharply diverged. As early as 1778 Spain had begun to
open her dependencies to Foreign trade, and early in
this century they were allowed to trade with one
another. So, likewise, although great changes had been
earlier made in the English colonies, the spirit of
monopoly and of a restrictive policy was in force until
about 1815. So far as relates to the evils of the colonial
system, then, the two were not very unlike. But into
the field of administrative reform and the grant of
autonomous powers to her colonies, Spain never has entered.
The abuses of the early part of the century characterize
also its later years. Discrimination against the<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>
native-born, even of the purest Spanish stock; officials
who regard the colony as a mine to be worked, not a
trust to be administered; forced dependence upon the
mother country for manufactures, even for produce, so
far as duties can effect it; self-government stifled; representation
in the Cortes denied or a nullity; a civil service
unprogressive, ignorant, sometimes corrupt&mdash;compare
these handicaps with the growth, the prosperity,
the independence, above all, the decent and orderly administration,
of the colonies of England. One of the
wonderful things in this half century is that army of
British youth, with but little special training or genius,
or even, perhaps, conscious sympathy for the work,
learning to administer the great and growing Indian
and colonial empire honestly and wisely and well, with
courage and judgment equal to emergencies, animated
by an every-day working sense of duty and honor, but
not very often making any fuss or phrases about it. It
is not that Spanish colonial government is worse than
formerly, which is costing it now so dear, but that it is
no better, while the world's standard has advanced and
condemns it. Never yet has Spain looked at her colonies
with their own welfare uppermost in her mind. She
has never outgrown the old mistaken theories. Her
fault is medievalism, alias ignorance.</p>

<p>"It is not a cause for wonder, therefore, quite apart
from special sources of discontent, that Cuba, which, by
position is thrown into contact with progressive peoples,
should chafe at her leading strings. Without reference
to the corruption and cruelty, arrogance, injustice<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>
and repression which are alleged against the mother
country, without rhetoric and without animosity, we
may fairly say that Spain is losing Cuba, perhaps all
her colonies, simply because she has not conformed to
the standard of the time in the matter of colonial government.
If England had not altered her own methods,
her colonies would long since have abandoned her as
opportunity offered. The wonder really is that Spain
has held hers so long; for Cuba, at least, owing to its
exceptional fertility and position, has relatively outstripped
its declining mother.</p>

<p>"There remains the moral of the story.</p>

<p>"If we are not mistaken as to the fundamental causes
of Spain's colonial weakness, other colonial powers
must take warning also, and the United States in particular,
if it yields to the temptations, or, as many say,
assumes the divinely-ordered responsibilities, of the
situation. For its protective system is a derivative of
the mercantile system, as the colonial system was. If it
becomes a colonial power, but attempts by heavy duties
to limit the foreign trade of its colonies, if it administers
those colonies through officials of the spoils type, if it
fails to enlarge the local liberties and privileges of its
dependencies up to the limit of their receptive powers&mdash;if,
in short, it holds colonies for its own aggrandizement,
instead of their well-being&mdash;it will be but repeating
the blunders of Spain, and the end will be disaster."</p>

<p>Colonel Hill has declared that the heavy burdens
under which the business world of Porto Rico has been
staggering in the past have been almost inconceivable.<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>
Something of this has already been said, but it may be
well to give Colonel Hill's views, as he is certainly a
most competent judge. The colonel says that in the first
place there has been a tax on every ship that comes in
and goes out. There has been a heavy tax on all articles
of impost and a special tax on all articles not enumerated
in the tariff. In addition to that, an additional tax
of ten per cent. on the bill was added. Each hackman
who plied between the port and the town of Ponce had
to pay a tax of eight dollars a month. No person could
write a letter to an official without first going to the
collector and purchasing a certain kind of official paper,
for which he must pay fifty cents to one dollar a sheet.
The price was regulated by the rank of the official who
had to be written to.</p>

<p>The effect of all this was rather to increase the number
of complaints from citizens than to increase the
revenues of the island.</p>

<p>To General Ernst, who was the officer in command of
the territory of Coamo, a large number of protests were
made. In especial, a delegation of twelve to fifteen citizens
called upon the general to request the removal of
the alcalde, on the ground that he had been an officer in
the Spanish volunteer army, and was unsatisfactory
because of his former connections. The gentleman,
however, had gracefully accepted the new condition
of affairs and was performing the duties of his office
earnestly and faithfully. These facts General Ernst
was in possession of and he was forced in consequence
to deny the request of the delegation.<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></p>

<p>For his own protection and to remove any false impression
there might be in the public mind, General
Ernst issued the following proclamation, which was
printed in both English and Spanish:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 18%;">"Headquarters 1st Brigade, 1st Div.,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 22%;">1st Army Corps, Camp Near Coamo,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 30%;">Porto Rico, September 3, 1898.</span><br />
</p>

<p>To the People of Coamo and Neighboring Districts:</p>

<p>"To prevent misunderstanding as to the rights and
duties of the various members of this community, you
are respectfully informed:</p>

<p>"1. That no change has been made in the civil laws
of Porto Rico, and that none can be made except by the
Congress of the United States. The present civil authorities
are to be obeyed and respected.</p>

<p>"2. That no prejudice rests against any citizen,
whether in office or not, for having served as a volunteer,
if he now frankly accepts the authority of the
United States.</p>

<p>"3. That the persecution of persons simply because
they are Spaniards, or Spanish sympathizers, will not be
tolerated. They, as well as the Porto Ricans, are all expected
to become good American citizens, and, in any
event, they are entitled to the protection of the law until
they violate it.</p>

<p class="r">O. H. Ernst,<br />
"Brigadier-General Commanding."</p>

<p class="top5">About this time President McKinley promulgated
through the War Department the revised customs tariff<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>
and regulations to be enforced by the military authorities
in the ports of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>In general, the regulations for Porto Rico were practically
the same as those promulgated for Cuba and the
Philippines. The one important difference was that
trade between ports in the United States and ports and
places in the possession of the United States in Porto
Rico be restricted to registered vessels of the United
States and prohibited to all others. It was provided that
any merchandise transported in violation of this regulation
should be subject to forfeiture, and that for every
passenger transported and landed in violation of this
regulation the transporting vessel should be subject to a
penalty of $200.</p>

<p>This regulation should not be construed to forbid the
sailing of other than registered vessels of the United
States with cargo and passengers between the United
States and Porto Rico, provided that they were not
landed, but were destined for some foreign port or place.</p>

<p>It was further provided that this regulation should
not be construed to authorize lower tonnage taxes or
other navigation charges on American vessels entering
the ports of Porto Rico from the United States than were
paid by foreign vessels from foreign countries, nor to
authorize any lower customs charges or tariff charges
on the cargoes of American vessels entering from the
United States than were paid on the cargoes of foreign
vessels entering from foreign ports.</p>

<p>The regulations as to entering and clearing vessels
and the penalties for the violation were the same as<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>
those fixed for Cuban ports in the possession of the
United States. The tonnage dues were reduced, as in
Cuba, to twenty cents per ton on vessels entering from
ports other than Porto Rican ports in the possession of
the United States, and two cents a ton on vessels from
other ports in Porto Rico. The landing charge of $1 per
ton was abolished, and the special tax of fifty cents on
each ton of merchandise landed at San Juan and Mayaguez
for harbor improvement was continued.</p>

<p>As in Cuba, the Spanish minimum tariff was to be
collected. On most articles, however, this was much
higher than the minimum tariff which was imposed by
Spain in Cuba. The differential in Porto Rico imposed
on goods imported from countries other than Spain was
much smaller than in Cuba, so that under Spanish rule
there was not a wide difference between duties on goods
from countries other than Spain imported into the two
islands. Under the operation of the President's orders
imposing the minimum tariffs in both islands the effect
would be to tax most articles much higher in Porto Rico
than in Cuba. As in Cuba, a tariff was imposed on tobacco,
manufactured tobacco, cigars and cigarettes
equivalent to the internal revenue taxes imposed in the
United States.</p>

<p>Richard Harding Davis says that there will be no
such complications in Porto Rico as those which exist
in Cuba for the United States troops there were not
allies. They were men who came, were seen and conquered.
The revolutionary leaders had no share or
credit in their triumphal progress.<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></p>

<p>Now to examine into what Porto Rico offers for
American enterprise and capital.</p>

<p>In the first place, United States Consul Hanna has
been flooded with letters from fortune hunters. He
strongly advised all of them to remain at home until the
Americans were in complete control. Now, let us examine
what one or two competent authorities have to
say of Porto Rico, so far as American enterprise is concerned.</p>

<p>Here is the opinion of a man who has lived in Porto
Rico for several years and who knows of what he is
speaking:</p>

<p>"We take Porto Rico, too, at a time when everything
favors increased prosperity. It has not been ravaged
and wrecked, like Cuba, by war. Its foreign trade in
1896, amounting to $36,624,120, was the largest in its
history, the value of the exports then, for the first time
in over ten years, exceeding that of the imports. Of
course the main trade has always been with Spain, but
the trade with us stands next, and during the year in
question was over two-thirds of that with Spain. Of late,
it is true, our trade with Porto Rico has been relatively
declining, being far less than it was a quarter of a century
ago. During the reciprocity period of a few years
since it increased somewhat, but after that it fell off
again. It is important to note, however, that our exports
to Porto Rico have kept well up of late years, the
falling off in total trade being due to the decline of our
imports, so that now the exports are not far from equal
to the imports, instead of being much inferior as formerly.
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>It is a noteworthy fact that the exchange from both
countries is mostly of products of the soil. That is the
case with ninety-nine hundredths of Porto Rico's exports
to us, sugar and molasses comprising 85 per cent.,
with coffee coming next, and it is also true of over
three-fifths of our exports to Porto Rico, among which
breadstuffs and meat foods are prominent.</p>

<p>"But with Porto Rico fully ours, and the discriminations
enforced by past laws in favor of Spanish trade
wiped out, there must be a change in the currents of
her commerce. We shall expect to furnish the chief
markets for her products, and on the other hand to send
to the island more food products than ever, more machinery,
textile fabrics, iron and steel. Her capabilities
will be developed, perhaps notably in coffee cultivation.
Her peaceful and industrious people will welcome
American enterprise and capital, American progressive
methods, and free institutions. Indeed one of the most
striking events of this year was the extraordinary enthusiasm
with which American troops were greeted all
along the southern shores of the island. It was as if the
people could already forecast the great future in store
for them, under American laws and the American flag."</p>

<p>A correspondent of the New York Evening Post, who
signs himself by the initials A. G. R., speaks with
authority as follows:</p>

<p>"The prominence given to the island by the events of
recent months has led many of our people to think it of
vastly greater importance, commercially, than it really
is. Consul Hanna, who is back in his old quarters in<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>
San Juan, has a small wheelbarrow load of letters from
all parts of the United States, asking detailed information
upon all conceivable lines of trade, manufacture
and profession. To answer them according to the terms
of their requests would be the work of a short lifetime.
But they indicate the widespread interest of American
business men in Porto Rican mercantile affairs. Every
steamer arriving here brings its group of American passengers.
Some are visitors who make the trip only
through curiosity. The majority come with an idea of
some form of business, either in the shape of a speculative
flyer, permanent investment, or a commercial or
industrial establishment.</p>

<p>"A large percentage of those who come are young
men, who have just about enough money to get them
here, to keep them here for a week or two, and then get
them home again. These come in the hope of finding
immediate employment, of catching on to something
which will maintain them. They invariably go home
again. The island is no place for such. None but the
capitalist, the investor, or the business man with money
for his business, should come to Porto Rico with anything
more in view than an outing or a vacation. As
things are at present, there is little enough to interest
the capitalist or the investor. The man who is looking
for a job should look for it at home; his chances are infinitely
better than they are here. There is absolutely
nothing for the position hunter, for the clerk, or for the
workman. In time there may be something, but it will
be, at the least, many months before such opportunities<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>
are open, and even then they will be few. Until then
the case is hopeless, and those who come will but do as
their predecessors have done&mdash;go home again, poorer
and wiser men. If a young man can afford to spend a
couple of hundred dollars in the purchase of that particular
form of wisdom, the opportunity is open to him
here on this island. If he cannot afford it, he will do
better not to risk it.</p>

<p>"Merchants will find nothing to do here, except to
glean a certain amount of information of rather doubtful
accuracy, until the question of tariff rates shall have
been definitely settled. There is now nothing on which
to base any plans or calculations for business operations.
The native merchants are complaining seriously. They
are waiting to place orders for hundreds of thousands of
dollars' worth of goods to replenish stocks which have
been depleted through many mouths of uncertain trade
conditions, and are losing business which they have
been led to expect would be open to them almost immediately
after the American occupation of the different
cities in which they are located. Nor is it at all easy for
an American to obtain any definite information or accurate
details regarding any particular line of business
and its possibilities. Local commercial methods are not
reduced to the system which prevails among American
business men. The Porto Rican merchant buys and sells,
but I fail to find evidence of that close study of business
and business methods by which the American merchant
increases his trade and his profits.</p>

<p>"The entire trade of the island is of no very great<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>
magnitude. The local trade in local products is chiefly
confined to the morning market for table supplies,
which is held in all the cities and larger towns. The
total imports and exports hardly reach a gross amount
of thirty millions of dollars a year, and the imports exceed
the exports by a couple of millions. I have been
unable to find any statistics which I was willing to
accept as wholly reliable. So far as I can learn, no complete
report has been submitted by the United States
Consul, and there are discrepancies which I cannot
reconcile in the published reports of the English Consul
and those of the Dutch Consul. I can, therefore, only
give figures which are approximate, though they are
sufficiently close for general purposes.</p>

<p>"Cotton goods appear to be the largest item among the
imports, and they represent a trade of two or three millions
of dollars, varying from year to year, according to
the prices and the success or failure of the crop products
of the island. Rice is imported to the value of one
and a half to two millions of dollars. Flour, chiefly from
the United States, approximates three-quarters of a million
dollars. Dried, salt and pickled fish, of which
Canada seems to obtain the lion's share of the trade,
represents a million to a million and a quarter. The
United States has the major portion of a trade in pork
and pork products which about equals the fish business.</p>

<p>"Woollen goods are, naturally, of but limited consumption
in so warm a climate, and the trade is probably less
than $150,000 in amount. Agricultural implements represent
a business of three to four hundred thousand dollars.
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>Boots and shoes, almost exclusively from Spain,
represent some five or six hundred thousand. Chinaware,
glassware, lumber, coal, soap, furniture and other articles
of general use and consumption represent amounts
varying from one to three or four hundred thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>"The most astonishing thing in the whole list of importations
is the item of vegetable and garden products.
These are imported into this country, which is in itself
but a natural garden in which can and should be raised
every form of vegetable necessary or desirable for consumption,
and the annual value of the imports approximates
$400,000 and the weight 7,000 tons. The island
uses $150,000 worth of imported candles and $50,000
worth of imported butter yearly. It uses two to three
hundred thousand dollars' worth of cheese, of which the
Netherlands have, for the last few years, furnished
much the greater part. Uruguay and the Argentine supply
it with one to three thousand tons of jerked beef
annually. Wines, beers, and liquors take something
more than a half a million a year out of the country.</p>

<p>"Among Porto Rican exports coffee is the heaviest
item. This reaches an average valuation of some $10,000,000
a year. Sugar ranks next, and approximates
three to four million dollars. Tobacco goes to the extent
of some half a million, and molasses touches about the
same figure. Hides, cattle, timber and fruit are represented
in the list, but their value is comparatively inconsiderable.
Guano to the extent of half a million a
year appears in the reports for some years, but I am <a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>unable
to account for either the article or the amount.
Some corn has been sent to Cuba, some native rum to
Spain, and some bay rum to France and to the United
States.</p>

<p>"It will thus be seen that, as yet, the island offers
but a comparatively limited amount of business, either
in buying or selling. Under wise laws, and a just and
equitable system of taxation, with a suitable railway
system and improved highways, and with the ports of
the United States and of the islands open to the exchange
of commodities, free of duty, a very material increase
of the business of the island will inevitably follow.
It is quite possible to double the trade within the
next ten or fifteen years. There will be some wildcat
speculation, some unwise investment and some loss to
investors. The schemer and the promoter will find victims
who will put their money into companies whose
future is wholly hopeless. But along with that there
may reasonably be expected a steady growth and improvement.
But it will come by gradual increase and development,
and not by a sudden bound."</p>

<p>According to Mr. William J. Morrisey, a prominent
real estate dealer of Brooklyn, who spent some time in
Porto Rico, the island is no place for an American to
invest any money at present. He says that the place can
be made to pay, provided the United States Government
clears the entire island of Spaniards and fills the towns
and cities with the American people.</p>

<p>Mr. Morrisey also states that the natives of the cities
are desirous of becoming American citizens, but that<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>
out in the country, it is far different. These people are
constantly in fear of the Americans, and their sole desire
is to dispose of their property as soon as possible and
return to Spain. The more enlightened of them are of
the opinion that the United States Government will
banish all the Spaniards from the island and thereby
make it more agreeable for the residents.</p>

<p>A dispatch of the Evening Post says that in view of
representations made to the War Department that the
municipal councils in Porto Rico were making hay while
the sun shines, and granting business franchises right
and left under the Spanish law empowering them to do
so, orders were recently issued to General Brooke to put
a stop to the practice forthwith, and the announcement
was given out that on the evacuation by the Spaniards,
and our assumption of military authority in the island,
no more of these loose grants would be made. Meanwhile
American shippers were in a state of mind over a
lack of ships with which to conduct the normal commerce
of this country with Porto Rico. The change of
status for the island, from being a foreign possession to
a port of the United States coast, had made the rigid
regulations of our coasting trade applicable to it, and
the purchase of so many of our coasting vessels by the
government for use as transports, coalers, and the like,
had embarrassed the progress of coast commerce not a
little. The regulations had to be suspended on two or
three occasions to let in ships which seemed absolutely
necessary, and now the question came up whether it
would be best to suspend the regulations altogether or<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>
to have each separate vessel which needed American
papers apply to Congress for special legislation.</p>

<p>There was another question, and a very important
one, which came up, and that was how far Louisiana
and other sugar-producing States would be affected by
the annexation of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>In no State in the Union does a single interest play
so important and so peculiar a part as the sugar industry
in Louisiana. Fully two-fifths of the inhabitants of the
State are more or less interested in sugar, and any great
disaster to the crop would injure ninety per cent. of the
population in southern Louisiana.</p>

<p>So far as Porto Rico goes, it is very doubtful if it will
injure Louisiana in any way. As has been said before,
the island is densely populated, small in area, and with
little additional land available for sugar. It is by no
means probable that it will increase materially in its
sugar production. American laws will militate against
the importation of contract labor, and will therefore
prevent any undue competition. As the New York Sun
very justly observes, the bugbear of the Louisiana sugar
planter is not territorial expansion, but the war taxes
and the possibility of their permanent adoption, bringing
with it the reopening of the old tariff agitation,
which they supposed was permanently closed.</p>

<p>Taking it all in all, territorial expansion has certainly
no terrors for the Louisiana planters.</p>

<p>With the evidence we have given, it is easy to see
what Porto Rico has to offer, or not to offer, to Americans.<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></p>

<p>With their usual manana, the Spaniards have been
slow to evacuate the island, but a decisive stand has
been taken by the President.</p>

<p>The chief intent of the administration is to clear the
island of Spaniards, put at work American methods in
sanitary, civic and economic administration, and, for
the purpose of doing this without annoyance, to have
forces enough for police duty.</p>

<p>The day fixed for the hoisting of the American flag
over San Juan and the complete and permanent occupation
of Porto Rico by the military forces of the United
States was October 18.</p>

<p>It was possible for the Administration of the United
States to take this step by virtue of war powers and of
the establishment of the fact that Porto Rico is to be
wholly and permanently American.</p>

<p>At the present time of writing Porto Rico is still a
foreign country, so far as the laws of the United States
are concerned, and until changed by Congress, customs
duties will be collected on imports from the island. So,
too, with the navigation laws, and American ship-owners
are warned to secure registers for foreign commerce
before entering the Porto Rico trade, as vessels
with only coasting enrollments and licenses will
be subject to penalty on their return to the United
States.</p>

<p>On the 18th of October, promptly at noon, the flag
was raised over San Juan.</p>

<p>An excellent description of the proceedings has been
given in the Boston Herald, and reads as follows:<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></p>

<p>"The ceremony was quiet and dignified, unmarred by
disorder of any kind.</p>

<p>"The 11th regular infantry, with two batteries of the
5th artillery, landed. The latter proceeded to the fort,
while the infantry lined up on the docks. It was a holiday
for San Juan, and there were many people in the
streets.</p>

<p>"Rear Admiral Schley and General Gordon, accompanied
by their staffs, proceeded to the palace in carriages.
The 11th infantry regiment and band, with troop
H of the 6th U. S. cavalry, then marched through the
streets, and formed in the square opposite the palace.
At 11.40 A. M. General Brooke, Admiral Schley and
General Gordon, the United States evacuation commissioners,
came out of the palace with many naval officers,
and formed on the right side of the square. The street
behind the soldiers was thronged with townspeople,
who stood waiting in dead silence.</p>

<p>"At last the city clock struck the hour of 12, and the
crowds, almost breathless, and with eyes fixed upon the
flag pole, watched for developments. At the sound of
the first gun from Fort Morro, Major Dean and Lieutenant
Castle of General Brooke's staff hoisted the stars
and stripes, while the band played the 'Star Spangled
Banner.'</p>

<p>"All heads were bared, and the crowds cheered. Fort
Morro, Fort San Cristobal and the United States revenue
cutter Manning, lying in the harbor, fired 21 guns
each.</p>

<p>"Senor Munoz Rivera, who was president of the<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>
recent autonomist council of secretaries, and other officials
of the late insular government were present at the
proceedings.</p>

<p>"Congratulations and handshaking among the American
officers followed. Ensign King hoisted the stars and
stripes on the Intendencia, but all other flags on the
various public buildings were hoisted by military officers.
Simultaneously with the raising of the flag over the captain-general's
palace many others were hoisted in different
parts of the city.</p>

<p>"The work of the United States' evacuation commission
was now over. The labors of both parties terminated
with honor for all concerned."</p>

<p>After the parade the bands and various trade organizations
went to General Henry's headquarters. General
Henry in a speech said:</p>

<p>"Alcalde and Citizens: To-day the flag of the United
States floats as an emblem of undisputed authority over
the island of Porto Rico, giving promise of protection
to life, of liberty, prosperity and the right to worship
God in accordance with the dictates of conscience. The
forty five States represented by the stars emblazoned
on the blue field of that flag unite in vouchsafing to you
prosperity and protection as citizens of the American
Union.</p>

<p>"Your future destiny rests largely with yourselves.
Respect the rights of each other. Do not abuse the government
which accords opportunities to the individual
for advancement. Political animosities must be forgotten
in unity and in the recognition of common interests.<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>
I congratulate you all on beginning your public life
under new auspices, free from governmental oppression,
and with liberty to advance your own country's interests
by your united efforts."</p>

<p>General Henry then introduced Colonel John B.
Castleman, who spoke with great effect as an old Confederate.</p>

<p>The alcalde replied in part:</p>

<p>"We hope soon to see another star symbolic of our
prosperity and of our membership in the great republic
of States. Porto Rico has not accepted American domination
on account of force. She suffered for many years
the evils of error, neglect and persecution, but she had
men who studied the question of government, and who
saw in America her redemption and a guarantee of life,
liberty and justice.</p>

<p>"Then we came willingly and freely, hoping, hand
in hand with the greatest of all republics, to advance
in civilization and progress, and to become part of the
republic to which we pledge our faith forever."</p>

<p>When the Spanish flag was hauled down all over the
island and the Stars and Stripes raised in its place,
General Brooke became the chief executive of Porto
Rico. Actually, but not in name, he was the military
governor of the island. The plan of a military governor
for Porto Rico, to hold until the Washington authorities
deem it wise to substitute a purely civil administration,
has not been fully arranged. From October 18
until the plan of the Government has been put into
effect, General Brooke, or the military officer who will<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>
succeed him if he asks for detachment, will be in
supreme control of civil and military affairs. It is the
intention, however, of the Government here to have as
little of the military element as possible in the administration
of affairs, and so to all intents and purposes a
civil administration will be in operation from the time
the Spaniards surrendered authority.</p>

<p>Still, when all has been said, it is perfectly sure that
in the end Porto Rico will become one of the most important
of our possessions. Superstition and tyranny
will be driven from this most fertile island, and hope
and peace, under the Stars and Stripes, will be brought
to the thousands so long under foot.</p>

<p>Hail, therefore to Porto Rico! And some day may it
become a bright star in the flag that brings protection
and freedom to all!</p>
